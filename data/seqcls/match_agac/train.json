Description de 8 nouvelles familles avec mutations du gène @GENE$.\nINTRODUCTION: @DISEASE$ (LGMD1B), due to @GENE$ gene mutations, is a relatively rare form of LGMD characterized by proximal muscle involvement associated with heart involvement comprising atrio-ventricular conduction blocks and dilated cardiomyopathy. Its clinical and genetic diagnosis is crucial for cardiac management and genetic counselling. Seven @GENE$ mutations have been previously reported to be responsible for LGMD1B.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe the neurological and cardiologic features of 14 patients belonging to 8 families in whom we identified 6 different @GENE$ mutations, 4 of them having never been reported. Results. Eleven patients had an LGMD1B phenotype with scapulohumeral and pelvic-femoral involvement. Thirteen patients had cardiac disease associating conduction defects (12 patients) or arrhythmias (9 patients). Seven patients needed cardiac device (pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator) and two had heart transplantation.\nCONCLUSION: This study allowed us to specify the clinical characteristics of this entity and to outline the first phenotype/genotype relations resulting from these observations.", "label": "REG"}

Primarily, mutations in @GENE$ have been associated to the autosomal forms of @DISEASE$, a rare slowly progressive humero-peroneal muscular dystrophy accompanied by early contractures and dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects. @GENE$ mutations have been reported to be responsible for up to 10 distinct phenotypes that affect specifically either the skeletal and/or cardiac muscle, the adipose tissue, the peripheral nervous tissue, the bone tissue or more recently premature ageing. So far more than 180 different @GENE$ mutations have been identified in 903 individuals. The first studies of phenotype/genotype relationships revealed no dear relation between the phenotype and the type and/or the localization of the mutation, except perhaps for the globular tail domain of lamins A/C. Studies of the consequences of @GENE$ mutations in the skin cultured fibroblasts from the patients reveal abnormal nuclei in variable proportions, with dysmorphic nuclei exhibiting abnormal patterns of expression of B-type lamins and emerin. Finally, the development of KO and KI @GENE$ mice, will certainly give further insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with @GENE$ mutations.

{"id": 3, "sentence": "A novel mutation of the cathepsin C gene in a thai family with @DISEASE$.\nBACKGROUND: @DISEASE$ (PLS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by palmar- plantar hyperkeratosis and rapid periodontal destruction of both primary and permanent dentitions. It has been shown that the disease is caused by cathepsin C gene (@GENE$) mutation leading to the deficiency of cathepsin C enzymatic activity. This study demonstrates the clinical manifestations and @GENE$ mutational and enzymatic activity analyses in a 5-year-old Thai male PLS patient and his parents.\nMETHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained for genomic DNA isolation. All exons of the @GENE$ gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers. Mutations were identified by DNA sequencing. Verification of the mutation was performed by digestion of PCR products by restriction endonucleases. The cathepsin C enzymatic activity was determined using the synthetic substrate glycyl- L-arginine-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin.\nRESULTS: The patient demonstrated classical characteristics of PLS, including hyperkeratotic skin lesions. By the age of 5, all of his primary teeth were extracted due to severe periodontal infection. The parents had no physical abnormalities. The periodontal examination revealed localized mild periodontal destruction. Sequence analysis showed a nucleotide change at position 90 from C >A (c.90C >A) which resulted in a change from cysteine residue to a premature stop codon at the amino acid position 30 in the exon 1. The HpyCH4V digestion revealed that the patient was homozygous, whereas both the father and mother were heterozygous carriers of this mutation. The cathepsin C activity was reduced in the patient's mother, and the activity in the patient was almost completely lost.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate a @GENE$ gene mutation in a Thai family with PLS. The identified mutation is novel and potentially leads to the drastic reduction of the cathepsin C enzymatic activity. This suggests that the mutation is pathogenetic, causing the PLS. Mutational analysis in more members of the family is warranted to identify whether the mutation is inherited from a common ancestor.", "label": "LOF"}

Children affected with this disease tend to develop normally for the first 5 years of life. However, once disease onset occurs, they decline rapidly and die in their late 20s to early 30s. Though this represents the typical disease course, the onset and severity of disease symptoms can vary. This variability is presumed to be the result of both differences in the causative genetic mutation in the @GENE$ gene as well as environmental influences. Most cases of JNCL are caused by a 1 kb deletion in the @GENE$ gene, resulting in a frameshift mutation predicted to leave the first 153 amino acids of the @GENE$ protein intact, followed by the addition of 28 novel amino acids. Here we report the discovery of a novel mutation identified as a G to T transversion at nucleotide 49 (G49T) in exon 2 of @GENE$, introducing a premature stop codon (E17X) near the N-terminus.

{"id": 16, "sentence": "Novel @GENE$/SMCX mutations in patients with @DISEASE$.\n@DISEASE$ (XLMR) is a heterogeneous disorder that affects approximately 2 in 1000 males. @GENE$/SMCX is relatively new among the known XLMR genes, and seven different mutations have been identified previously in this gene [Jensen LR et al., Am. J. Hum. Genet. 76:227-236, 2005]. Here, we report five novel @GENE$ mutations in five XLMR families. The changes comprise one nonsense mutation (p.Arg332X) and four missense mutations (p.Asp87Gly; p.Phe642Leu; p.Arg750Trp; p.Tyr751Cys) affecting evolutionarily conserved amino acids. The degree of mental retardation in the affected males ranged from mild to severe, and some patients suffered from additional disorders such as epilepsy, short stature, or behavioral problems. This study brings the total number of reported @GENE$ mutations to twelve. In contrast to other XLMR genes in which mutations were found only in single or very few families, @GENE$ appears to be one of the more frequently mutated genes in this disorder.", "label": "REG"}
{"id": 17, "sentence": "Missense mutations in @GENE$ identified in patients with @DISEASE$ differentially affect the expression and function of SAP.\n@DISEASE$ (XLP) is an immunodeficiency resulting from mutations in @GENE$, which encodes signalling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM)-associated protein (SAP). In addition to SLAM, SAP associates with several other cell-surface receptors including 2B4 (CD244), Ly9 (CD229), CD84 and NTB-A. SAP contains a single src-homology-2 domain and acts as an intracellular adaptor protein by recruiting the protein tyrosine kinase FynT to the cytoplasmic domains of some of these receptors, which results in the initiation of specific downstream signal transduction pathways. XLP is likely to result from perturbed signalling through one or more of these SAP-associating receptors. In this study, we identified missense (Y54C, I84T and F87S) and insertion (fs82 --> X103) mutations in four different kindreds affected by XLP. Each mutation dramatically reduced the half-life of SAP, thus diminishing its expression in primary lymphocytes as well as in transfected cell lines. Interestingly, although the Y54C and F87S mutations compromised the ability of SAP to associate with different receptors, the I84T mutation had no effect on the ability of SAP to bind SLAM, CD84 or 2B4. However, signalling downstream of SLAM was reduced in the presence of SAP bearing the I84T mutation. These findings indicate that, irrespective of the type of mutation, signalling through SAP-associating receptors in XLP can be impaired by reducing the expression of SAP, the ability of SAP to bind surface receptors and/or its ability to activate signal transduction downstream of the SLAM-SAP complex.", "label": "LOF"}

It is a late onset neurological disorder recognized by recurrent strokes and dementia. We describe here the clinical and molecular findings of three unrelated Turkish families with @DISEASE$. Two of the families were identified to have the same mutation, p.R110C (c.C328T), located in exon 3 of the @GENE$ gene. Interestingly, the phenotypic expression of the disease in these two families was markedly different in severity and age of onset implicating additional genetic and/or non-genetic modulating factors involved in the pathogenesis. In addition, we identified the novel p.C201R (c.T601C) mutation in exon 4 of the @GENE$ gene in a proband of the third family with two consecutive stroke-like episodes and typical MRI findings. Mutations described here cause an odd number of cysteines in the N-terminal of the EGF domain of @GENE$ protein, which seems to have an important functional effect in the pathophysiology of CADASIL. The phenotypic variability in families carrying the same molecular defect as presented here makes the prediction of prognosis inconceivable. Although DNA analysis is effective and valuable in diagnosing approximately 90% of the CADASIL patients, lack of genotype-phenotype correlation and prognostic parameters makes the presymptomatic genetic counseling very difficult.", "label": "REG"}

Mortality results primarily from muscle wasting and cardiac arrhythmias. There are two forms of the disease: DM1 and DM2.

It is normally present in two forms, a full-length form B and an N-terminal truncated form A with still unknown function. Mutations in the @GENE$ gene cause @DISEASE$ (AIS), which is divided into subgroups according to the degree of undermasculinization. Patients with completely female external genitalia are classified as complete AIS (CAIS). However, a recent study has shown that some CAIS patients have signs of internal male genital differentiation due to missense mutations that show some degree of residual function.\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the expression of the different forms of the @GENE$ in two CAIS patients in relation to the development of male internal genital structures. One patient had a mutation (L7fsX33) that affects only the full-length @GENE$-B form of the @GENE$, whereas the other had a nonsense mutation (Q733X) affecting both isoforms.\nMEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We thoroughly analysed internal genitalia at surgery and by histological examination. No signs of Wolffian duct (WD) development were present in any of the patients. Western blotting of proteins from gonadal and genital skin fibroblasts was performed with @GENE$ antibodies directed against different @GENE$ epitopes.

Here, we demonstrate that a strain of WS fibroblast cells shows abnormal karyotypes characterized by several complex translocations and 50-fold more frequency of abnormal metaphases including dicentric chromosomes without fragments than normal cells when examined at a similar culture stage. Further, telomere fluorescence in situ hybridization indicates that the abnormal signals, extra telomere signal and loss of telomere signal, emerge two- to three-fold more frequently in WS cells than in normal cells. Taken together, these results indicate that chromosome instability including dysfunction of telomere maintenance is more prominent in WS cells than in normal cells. In addition, the accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at the G(1) phase, including those at telomeres, detected by phosphorylated ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) foci is accelerated in WS cells even at a low senescence level. The increased accumulation of DSBs in WS cells is reduced in the presence of anti-oxidative agents, suggesting that enhanced oxidative stress in WS cells is involved in accelerated accumulation of DSBs. These results indicate that WS cells are prone to accumulate DSBs spontaneously due to a defect of @GENE$, which leads to increased chromosome instability that could activate checkpoints, resulting in accelerated senescence.", "label": "GOF"}

The patients presented with a severe phenotype demonstrated by a high incidence of intracerebral haemorrhages (seven of eight patients), haemarthrosis (six patients) and bleeding due to trauma (five patients). Introduction of regular substitution with FXIII concentrate prevented spontaneous bleeding in seven patients. In all patients, mutations within the @GENE$ gene have been identified revealing four missense mutations (Arg77Cys, Arg260Cys, Ala378Pro, Gly420Ser), one nonsense mutation (Arg661X), one splice site mutation (IVS5-1 G>A) and one small deletion (c.499-512del). One homozygous large deletion involving exon 15 was detected by failure of PCR product. The corresponding mutations resulted in severely reduced FXIII activity and FXIII A-subunit antigen concentration, while FXIII B-subunit antigen remained normal or mildly decreased. Structural analysis demonstrated that the novel Ala378Pro mutation may cause a disruption of the FXIII catalytic triad leading to a non-functional protein which presumably undergoes premature degradation.

The purpose of this study was, by examining the electrophysiological responses of the retina, to evaluate the capacity of recovery of the whole retinal area and different cell types induced by extremely prolonged dark adaptation (DA) in BD disease and to gain further understanding of the pathogenesis of BD. Six young patients underwent bilateral full-field ERGs after 24 h of DA in one eye and standard DA in the fellow eye. The results were also compared with the effect of prolonged DA (10 h), previously studied in the same patients. After extremely prolonged DA (24 h) the rod b-wave and the mixed rod-cone a-wave responses reached normal though delayed amplitudes. An increase, up to normal level, in the oscillatory response was found. There was no obvious recovery of the cone response. We conclude that in young BD patients during extremely prolonged DA there is a significant additional capacity of recovery of rod function and also significant gain of activity in the inner retinal layer. A continuous but slow regeneration of rod photopigment seems to occur at least up to 24 h. The visual process in the RPE is retarded and @GENE$ acts in this process; also, the Müller cells of the retina seem to be involved.

Patients @DISEASE$ was identified in 2 Mexican mestizo sisters with healthy consanguineous parents. Clinical manifestations began at different ages.\nRESULTS: The onset of signs and symptoms of CHAC in the proband was at age 32 years and was characterized by balancing problems followed by chorea, compulsive lip and tongue biting with buccolingual self-mutilation, dysarthria, dysphagia, and weight loss. The first clinical manifestations in the proband's sister occurred at age 45 years and included multiple motor and verbal tics, with coprolalia, followed by lip and tongue biting, self-mutilation, and chorea. The clinical findings in both sisters were remarkable for acanthocytosis that developed late, when neurologic changes were already evident. Mutation screening of the @GENE$ gene revealed homozygosity for the frameshift mutation c.3556_3557dupAC in exon 33. Currently, the proband's sister, in whom neurologic defects developed 13 years after onset of CHAC in the proband, is the least affected.\nCONCLUSIONS: The same mutation of the @GENE$ gene can be expressed differently in the same family.

Mutations are mainly truncating mutations or deletions, missense mutations having been reported in few cases. An important phenotypic variability is observed among gene carriers. To assess whether the phenotypic variability of neurofibromatosis 2 could be linked to genotype, clinical data of 154 patients whose @GENE$ germline alteration had been identified in our laboratory have been collected.\nMETHODS: A retrospective questionnaire was sent to the physicians in charge of these patients. Statistical analyses regarding genotypic and phenotypic data were performed by comparisons of average values and correlation tests.\nRESULTS: In French patients, type of mutation was correlated neither with patients' sex, nor with disease occurrence mode (de novo or inherited mutation). Disease associated with missense mutations occurred later, with a less severe symptomatology. Patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations were more frequently affected with meningiomas and spinal tumours, in addition to VIII nerve schwannomas, an observation that underlies the genetic determination of the number and type of @GENE$-related tumours.\nCONCLUSION: Results from the literature as well as from our study tend to show that only few correlations exist between genotype and phenotype in the @GENE$ disease. It also recognizes that missense mutations have a lower level of evolution, severity and mortality risk. Nonsense and frameshift mutations seem to be associated with a higher number of meningiomas and spinal tumours. Therefore, @GENE$ gene screening keeps its indications in both typical and moderate forms of the disease. Mutations are responsible of 80 p.cent of typical forms; in moderate forms, identification of a missense mutation seems linked to a lower disease evolution. In any case, assessment and supervision should be identical. Finally, in a small number of cases, the @GENE$ gene appears to be implicated in clinical forms different from those defined by NIH and it might be of interest to enlarge the clinical features suggestive of the disease.", "label": "REG"}

Current advances in the function of NALPs support the recently proposed model of a disease continuum bridging autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders. Among these diseases, hereditary periodic fevers (HPFs) are Mendelian disorders associated with sequence variations in very few genes; these variations are mostly missense mutations whose deleterious effect, which is particularly difficult to assess, is often questionable. The growing number of identified sporadic cases of periodic fever syndrome, together with the lack of discriminatory clinical criteria, has greatly hampered the identification of new disease-causing genes, a step that is, however, essential for appropriate management of these disorders. Using a candidate gene approach, we identified nonambiguous mutations in @GENE$ (i.e., nonsense and splice site) in two families with periodic fever syndromes. As shown by means of functional studies, these two @GENE$ mutations have a deleterious effect on NF-kappaB signaling. Overall, these data identify a group of HPFs defined by molecular defects in @GENE$, opening up new ways to manage these disorders.

We determined that one patient (a 32-year-old woman) carried a heterozygous gene for a R767W mutation in exon 24, and another patient (a 17-year-old boy) carried a heterozygous gene for a novel frameshift mutation (Glu798FS) in exon 25. Recent studies have reported loss-of-function mutations in the chloride channel 7 (@GENE$) gene as a cause of autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type II (ADO-II). The identification of gene mutations in Chinese with ADO has not been reported previously. In this study, we identified mutations of the @GENE$ gene in two unrelated Chinese families with ADO-II. Two probands with ADO-II were diagnosed based on their bone characteristics on X-rays and their laboratory results. All 25 exons of the @GENE$ gene, including the exon-intron boundaries, were sequenced. We found in family 1 that the proband (a 32-year-old woman) was heterozygous for a @GENE$ mutation. The nonsynonymous mutation consisted of a heterozygous C/T transition at codon 2327 in exon 24, which resulted in an arginine (CGG)-to tryptophan (TGG) substitution at position 767 (R767W). The same heterozygous mutation (C/T) was determined in her father and son, who were asymptomatic with normal skeleton radiography. In family 2, we found that the proband (a 17-year-old boy) carried a novel frameshift mutation (Glu798FS) resulting from a G insertion between codon 60 and codon 61 in exon 25. The heterozygous -/G insertion is predicted to elongate the peptide of @GENE$ by 120 amino acids after position 797 amino acids. Similarly, some individuals of this family carried the same heterozygous mutation, but they are all asymptomatic. Furthermore, the R767W and Glu798FS mutations were not found in 100 unrelated controls.

On electromyography (EMG), neuromyotonic discharges, that is, bursts of motor unit action potentials firing at high rates (120-300 HZ), were constantly observed in SJS mice in all muscles, except in the diaphragm. Neuromyotonic discharges were not influenced by general anesthesia and disappeared with curare administration. They persisted after complete motor nerve section, terminating only with Wallerian degeneration. These results demonstrate that perlecan deficiency in SJS provokes a neuromyotonic syndrome.

Selected confocal images of corneal layers were evaluated qualitatively for shape and degree of light reflection of deposits.\nRESULTS: Novel mutations in the @GENE$ gene (Y174C, K181R, and N233H) were identified. Additionally, cosegregation of the mutation (Y174C) and SCCD was confirmed in 1 pedigree, indicating that the mutation of the @GENE$ gene is causative for SCCD. The 3 mutations were absent in all 200 control chromosomes. In vivo laser confocal microscopy demonstrated subepithelial highly reflective crystals in 4 cases; the shapes of the crystals were needle-shaped (3 cases) or rectangular (1 case). A phenotype and genotype correlation was demonstrated in 1 pedigree, and phenotypic heterogeneity (SCCD with or without crystals caused by a same mutation of Y174C in the @GENE$ gene) also was demonstrated in 1 pedigree.\nCONCLUSIONS: Nonsynonymous novel mutations in the @GENE$ gene were detected in 3 unrelated Japanese pedigrees with SCCD, confirming the genetic heterogeneity of this disorder. In vivo laser confocal microscopy is capable of identifying characteristic corneal microstructural changes related to genetically mapped SCCD with high resolution, and phenotypic heterogeneity was presented.

{"id": 68, "sentence": "Clinical and molecular aspects of @DISEASE$.\n@DISEASE$ is a severe, congenital ocular malformation inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion with high penetrance and variable expression. Eye morphogenesis in humans involves a molecular genetic cascade in which a number of developmental genes interact in a highly organized process during the embryonic period to produce functional ocular structures. Among these genes, paired box gene 6 (@GENE$) has an essential role as it encodes a phylogenetically conserved transcription factor almost universally employed for eye formation in animals with bilateral symmetry, despite widely different embryological origins. To direct eye development, @GENE$ regulates the tissue-specific expression of diverse molecules, hormones, and structural proteins. In humans, @GENE$ is located in chromosome 11p13, and its mutations lead to a variety of hereditary ocular malformations of the anterior and posterior segment, among which @DISEASE$ and most probably foveal hypoplasia are the major signs. @DISEASE$ occurs due to decreased dosage of the @GENE$ gene and exists in both sporadic and familial forms. The mutations are scattered throughout the gene and the vast majority of those reported so far are nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, or splicing errors that are predicted to cause pre-mature truncation of the @GENE$ protein, causing haploinsufficiency.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the seizure-like event (SLE) and inter-SLE states in a female @GENE$-deficient mouse model of @DISEASE$ and compare them to those found in other spontaneous recurrent epilepsy models. The study was performed on a small population of female @GENE$-deficient mice using telemetric local field potential (LFP) recordings over a 24 h period. Durations of SLEs and inter-SLEs were extracted using a rule-based automated SLE detection system for both daytime and nighttime, as well as high and low power levels of the delta frequency range (0.5-4 Hz) of the recorded LFPs. The results suggest SLE occurrences are not influenced by circadian rhythms, but had a significantly greater association with delta power.

FLLD individuals usually express an impaired or non-functional LPL enzyme with low or absent triglyceride (TG) hydrolysis activity causing severe hypertriglyceridaemia. Here we report a case of FLLD in a 29-year-old man, who initially presented with eruptive cutaneous xanthomata, elevated plasma TG concentration but no other co-morbidities. Subsequent genetic testing of the patient revealed compound heterozygosity of a novel duplication (p.R44Kfs*4) leading to a premature stop codon in exon 2 and a known mutation (N291S) in exon 5 of the LPL gene. Further biochemical analysis of the patient's postheparin plasma confirmed a reduction of total lipase activity compared with his heterozygous father carrying the common N291S mutation and to a healthy control. Also the patient showed increased (1.85-fold) activity of hepatic lipase (HL), indicating a functional link between HL and LPL. In summary, we report a case of FLLD caused by compound heterozygosity of a new duplication and a common mutation in the LPL gene, resulting in residual LPL activity.

Surprisingly, the presence of deletions beyond a few nucleotides among over 150 reported deleterious mutations has not been described, raising the suspicion that this gene might be protected against the detrimental mechanisms of gene rearrangements. The quest for an @GENE$ mutation in a proband with AKU revealed with a SNP array five large regions of homozygosity (5-16 Mb), one of which includes the @GENE$ gene. A homozygous deletion of 649 bp deletion that encompasses the 72 nucleotides of exon 2 and surrounding DNA sequences in flanking introns of the @GENE$ gene was unveiled in a proband with AKU. The nature of this deletion suggests that this in-frame deletion could generate a protein without exon 2. Thus, we modeled the tertiary structure of the mutant protein structure to determine the effect of exon 2 deletion. While the two β-pleated sheets encoded by exon 2 were missing in the mutant structure, other β-pleated sheets are largely unaffected by the deletion. However, nine novel α-helical coils substituted the eight coils present in the native @GENE$ crystal structure. Thus, this deletion results in a deleterious enzyme, which is consistent with the proband's phenotype. Screening for mutations in the @GENE$ gene, particularly in the Middle East, ought to include this exon 2 deletion in order to determine its frequency and uncover its origin.", "label": "REG"}

Mutations in the @GENE$ (previously known as SPG4) gene that encodes the microtubule-severing protein called spastin, are the most common cause of the disease. The aetiology of the disease is poorly understood, but partial loss of microtubule-severing activity resulting from inactivating mutations in one @GENE$ allele is the most postulated explanation. Microtubule severing is important for regulating various aspects of the microtubule array, including microtubule number, length, and mobility. In addition, higher numbers of dynamic plus-ends of microtubules, resulting from microtubule-severing events, may play a role in endosomal tubulation and fission. Even so, there is growing evidence that decreased severing of microtubules does not fully explain HSP-SPG4. The presence of two translation initiation codons in @GENE$ allows synthesis of two spastin isoforms: a full-length isoform called M1 and a slightly shorter isoform called M87. M87 is more abundant in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues. Studies on rodents suggest that M1 is only readily detected in adult spinal cord, which is where nerve degeneration mainly occurs in humans with HSP-SPG4. M1, due to its hydrophobic N-terminal domain not shared by M87, may insert into endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and together with reticulons, atlastin and REEP1, may play a role in the morphogenesis of this organelle. Some mutated spastins may act in dominant-negative fashion to lower microtubule-severing activity, but others have detrimental effects on neurons without further lowering microtubule severing. The observed adverse effects on microtubule dynamics, axonal transport, endoplasmic reticulum, and endosomal trafficking are likely caused not only by diminished severing of microtubules, but also by neurotoxicity of mutant spastin proteins, chiefly M1. Some large deletions in @GENE$ might also affect the function of adjacent genes, further complicating the aetiology of the disease.", "label": "LOF"}

In this study, we reported a case of GS pedigree and reviewed pertinent literature so as to explore the relationship between clinical characteristics and genotype meanwhile provide recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of GS.\nDESIGN AND METHODS: This is a pedigree-based genetic study of GS and 11 members from one family were included. We summarized their clinical features, analyzed laboratory parameters related to GS and @GENE$ gene.\nRESULTS: The proband experienced intermittent severe symptoms of weakness accompanied by significant hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria in laboratory test with poor treatments. His mother had more slight symptoms of weakness than him with mild hypokalemia and hypocalciuria. Mild hypomagnesemia was also observed in his sister with occasional weakness. All other pedigree members had normal laboratory test with no GS-related symptoms. A homozygous mutation of @GENE$ gene (c.488C > T) was detected by genetic testing in three members, and six were carriers of this mutation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Genotype and phenotype vary significantly among GS patients.

Main outcome measures were genetic mutations, psychiatric profile, and their association.\nRESULTS: 23 mutations in @GENE$ gene were scattered over the entire gene, 14 of them novel. Two families shared the same mutation. Twenty-one patients (28.3%) had a history of psychiatric disorder, most of them mood disorders; another 7 (9.4%) patients were highly suspected of having a psychiatric disorder; 21 (27.6%) reported suicidal thoughts; and 5 (6.6%) had attempted suicide. Psychiatric phenotype demonstrated inter- and intra-familial variability, and was not associated with disease severity, family history of psychiatric disease, or mutation location.\nCONCLUSIONS: The cohort demonstrated genetic heterogeneity with no mutation cluster along the gene, and high prevalence of psychiatric disorders.

{"id": 148, "sentence": "@DISEASE$ (Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome).\n@DISEASE$ (IP; Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome; OMIM #308300) is an X-linked dominant neurocutaneous disorder with presumed male lethality. It is usually diagnosed in female newborns based on skin features (erythematous, vesicular, or bullous eruption in linear streaks). The skin lesions evolve into a verrucous stage, followed by atrophy and scarring, leaving linear areas of hypopigmentation and hyperpigmented macules in bizarre patterns following Blaschko's lines. Systemic and neurologic complications include focal seizures and hemorrhagic cerebral infarction in infants, and retinal vasculopathy leading to blindness. Hypodontia, conical or pegged teeth, and linear areas of alopecia persist into adulthood. IP is caused by mutation of the IKBKG/@GENE$ gene on Xq28. Deletion of exons 4 to 10 (@GENE$Δ4-10) accounts for about 80% of cases (familial and sporadic). @GENE$ mutation leads to loss of function of NF-κB, a critical protein that modulates cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and response to proinflammatory factors, leading to the characteristic features of IP. In female carriers, selective loss of cells expressing the mutant X-chromosome results in completely skewed X-inactivation in the majority of cases.

Hypoglycemia is common in CS neonates. A previously reported individual with the rare @GENE$ p.Gln22Lys had hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Autopsy showed a discrete pancreatic nodule. The morphologic and immunohistochemistry findings, including loss of p57(Kip2) protein, were identical to a focal lesion of congenital hyperinsulinism, however, no KCNJ11 or ABCC8 mutation was identified and germline derived DNA showed no alternation of the maternal or paternal 11p15 alleles. Here we report paternal uniparental disomy (pUPD) within the lesion, similar to the pUPD11p15.5 in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). The similar extent of the pUPD suggests a similar mechanism driving hyperinsulinemia in both conditions. After coincidental somatic LOH and pUPD, the growth promoting effects of the paternally derived @GENE$ mutation, in combination with the increased function of the adjacent paternally expressed IGF2, may together result in clonal expansion. Although this somatic LOH within pancreatic tissue resulted in hyperinsulinism, similar LOH in mesenchymal cells may drive embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS). Interestingly, biallelic IGF2 expression has been linked to rhabdomyosarcoma tumorigenesis and pUPD11 occurred in all 8 ERMS samples from CS individuals. Somatic KRAS and @GENE$ mutations occur with comparable frequency in isolated malignancies. Yet, the malignancy risk in CS is notably higher than in Noonan syndrome with a KRAS mutation.

Previously we reported enhanced proliferative activity associated with the activation of WNT5A/CDK6/pRb signalling in P@GENE$-deficient cells. The objective of this work was to elucidate the association between P@GENE$ deficiency, WNT5A signalling and cell proliferation in immortalized lymphoblasts from carriers of the c.709-1G > A @GENE$ mutation (asymptomatic and FTLD-TDP).\nMETHODS: We assessed cell proliferation in carriers of the c.709-1G > A @GENE$ gene mutation and controls without @GENE$ mutation and without sign of neurologic degeneration by cell counting or using an MTT assay. We used a luciferase assay to measure the nuclear factor-κ (NF-κ) activity. We evaluated messenger RNA levels using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and protein levels by immunoblotting. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to analyze the interaction between P@GENE$ and its receptors.\nRESULTS: We enrolled 19 carriers of the @GENE$ gene mutation and 10 controls in this study. The P@GENE$-deficient cells showed increased expression of WNT5A due to NF-κB signalling overactivation. We observed a competition between P@GENE$ and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) for binding both TNF receptors (TNFR) I and II. Blocking NF-κB signalling using wedelolactone or specific antibodies against TNFRs inhibited WNT5A overexpression and proliferation of P@GENE$-deficient cells. Conversely, the activation of NF-κB signalling by TNF-α increased WNT5A-dependent proliferation of control cells.\nLIMITATIONS: All cell lines were derived from individuals harboring the same splicing @GENE$ mutation. Nevertheless, most of the known @GENE$ mutations lead to haploinsufficiency of the protein.\nCONCLUSION: Our results revealed an important role of NF-κB signalling in P@GENE$-associated FTLD-TDP and confirm that P@GENE$ can bind to TNF-a receptors regulating the expression of WNT5A, suggesting novel targets for treatment of FTLD-TDP linked to @GENE$ mutations.", "label": "LOF"}

GSDIII patients first presented before the age of 1.5 years, hepatomegaly was the most common presenting clinical sign. Dietary management was very diverse and included frequent meals, uncooked cornstarch and continuous gastric drip feeding. Chronic complications involved the liver (hepatic cirrhosis, adenoma(s), and/or hepatocellular carcinoma in 11 %), heart (cardiac involvement and cardiomyopathy, in 58 % and 15 %, respectively, generally presenting in early childhood), and muscle (pain in 34 %). Type 2 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in eight out of 91 adult patients (9 %). In adult patients no significant correlation was detected between (non-) missense @GENE$ genotypes and hepatic, cardiac or muscular complications. This study demonstrates heterogeneity in a large cohort of ageing GSDIII patients. An international GSD patient registry is warranted to prospectively define the clinical course, heterogeneity and the effect of different dietary interventions in patients with GSDIII.", "label": "REG"}

{"id": 166, "sentence": "Mutational Spectrum of the @GENE$ Gene in AA Amyloidosis Associated With @DISEASE$.\nINTRODUCTION: @DISEASE$ (FMF) is a recessively inherited disease which is characterized by recurrent episodic fever, abdominal pain, and polyserositis. It is caused by mutations in the @GENE$ gene, encoding the pyrin protein. The most important complication of FMF is secondary (AA) amyloidosis that leads to kidney failure. This study aimed to identify the frequency and distribution of @GENE$ mutations in Turkish patients with FMF-associated AA amyloidosis.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 57 patients with FMF-associated AA amyloidosis and 60 healthy controls were included in this study. We analyzed the @GENE$ gene for E148Q, M694V, M680I, and V726A mutations and R202Q variant by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism methods.  Results. The male-female ratio was 0.72. The mean age of the patients was 29.8 ± 12.8 years. Among the patients, the rate of the @GENE$ mutations was found to be 77.2%. The most frequently observed genotype was homozygous M694V mutation, which was present in 17 patients (29.8%, P < .001), followed by compound heterozygous M680I/M694V (14.3%, P = .01). The R202Q allele frequencies were significantly different between patients and control group (P = .02; odds ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.30 to 0.94).\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, mutation analysis of @GENE$ gene confirmed that the most frequent mutation was homozygous M694V genotype. R202Q may be important in patients with FMF-associated AA amyloidosis. Thus, it is suggested that investigation of R202Q should be considered as a genetic test for Turkish FMF patients.", "label": "REG"}
{"id": 167, "sentence": "@DISEASE$, a Disease Associated with @GENE$ Mutations.\nNotch plays an important function in skeletal homeostasis, osteoblastogenesis, and osteoclastogenesis. @DISEASE$ (HCS) is a rare disease associated with mutations in @GENE$ leading to the translation of a truncated @GENE$ stable protein. As a consequence, a gain-of-@GENE$ function is manifested. HCS is inherited as an autosomal dominant disease although sporadic cases exist. HCS is characterized by craniofacial developmental defects, including platybasia and wormian bones, osteoporosis with fractures, and acro-osteolysis. Subjects may suffer severe neurological complications, and HCS presents with cardiovascular defects and polycystic kidneys. An experimental mouse model harboring a HCSNotch2 mutation exhibits osteopenia secondary to enhanced bone resorption suggesting this as a possible mechanism for the skeletal disease. If the same mechanisms were operational in humans, anti-resorptive therapy could correct the bone loss, but not necessarily the acro-osteolysis. In conclusion, HCS is a devastating disease associated with a gain-of-@GENE$ function resulting in diverse clinical manifestations.", "label": "GOF"}

An ophthalmic examination consisting of a fundus evaluation and electroretinography (ERG) was completed, and small aliquots of blood were collected from all participating individuals. Genomic DNA was extracted from white blood cells, and a genome-wide linkage or a locus-specific exclusion analysis was completed with polymorphic short tandem repeats (STRs). Two-point logarithm of odds (LOD) scores were calculated, and all coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of @GENE$ were sequenced to identify the causal mutation.\nRESULTS: The ophthalmic examination showed that affected individuals in all families manifest cardinal symptoms of RP. Genome-wide scans localized the disease phenotype to chromosome 8q, a region harboring @GENE$, a gene previously implicated in the pathogenesis of RP.

Mutant mice that were heterozygous for the human allele displayed disorganized ultrastructural properties of the aortic wall characterized by fragmented elastic lamellae, whereas mice homozygous for the human allele died shortly after parturition from ascending aortic aneurysm and spontaneous hemorrhage. These data suggest that a missense mutation in @GENE$ is associated with @DISEASE$ in humans, likely through insufficient cross-linking of elastin and collagen in the aortic wall. Mutation carriers may be predisposed to vascular diseases because of weakened vessel walls under stress conditions. @GENE$ sequencing for clinical TAAD may identify additional mutation carriers in the future. Additional studies using our mouse model of @GENE$-associated TAAD have the potential to clarify the mechanism of disease and identify novel therapeutics specific to this genetic cause.", "label": "LOF"}

J Inherit Metab Dis 21:191-194, 1998). The typical clinical picture is characterized by hepatorenal glycogen accumulation resulting in hepato- and nephromegaly, impaired utilization of glucose and galactose, proximal renal tubular dysfunction, rickets and severe short stature.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We report 2 Palestinian patients from 2 families who were homozygous for the mutation p.R301X (C>T) in exon 7of @GENE$ gene. Patient 1 showed clinical and laboratory improvement with age characterized by normal growth and resolution of rickets. Patient 2 had severe phenotype characterized by progressive weight loss, persistent metabolic acidosis, marked polyuria and clinical and laboratory findings of rickets progressing to death at age 10 months.\nCONCLUSION: This report further expands the clinical spectrum of FBS even with identical mutations.

{"id": 176, "sentence": "@GENE$ gene-environment interactions contribute to the etiological complexity of @DISEASE$: evidence from a mouse model.\n@DISEASE$ (HPE) is a common and severe human developmental abnormality marked by malformations of the forebrain and face. Although several genetic mutations have been linked to HPE, phenotypic outcomes range dramatically, and most cases cannot be attributed to a specific cause. Gene-environment interaction has been invoked as a premise to explain the etiological complexity of HPE, but identification of interacting factors has been extremely limited. Here, we demonstrate that mutations in @GENE$, which encodes a Hedgehog pathway transcription factor, can cause or predispose to HPE depending upon gene dosage. On the C57BL/6J background, homozygous @GENE$ loss of function results in the characteristic brain and facial features seen in severe human HPE, including midfacial hypoplasia, hypotelorism and medial forebrain deficiency with loss of ventral neurospecification. Although normally indistinguishable from wild-type littermates, we demonstrate that mice with single-allele @GENE$ mutations exhibit increased penetrance and severity of HPE in response to low-dose teratogen exposure. This genetic predisposition is associated with a @GENE$ dosage-dependent attenuation of Hedgehog ligand responsiveness at the cellular level. In addition to revealing a causative role for @GENE$ in HPE genesis, these studies demonstrate a mechanism by which normally silent genetic and environmental factors can interact to produce severe outcomes. Taken together, these findings provide a framework for the understanding of the extreme phenotypic variability observed in humans carrying @GENE$ mutations and a paradigm for reducing the incidence of this morbid birth defect.", "label": "LOF"}

Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment may improve the prognosis of this disease. The purpose of this study is to determine the role of targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) in the early diagnosis of BTHS in children with @DISEASE$.\nMETHODS: During the period between 2012 and 2015, a gene panel-based NGS approach was used to search for potentially disease-causing genetic variants in all patients referred to our institution with a clinical diagnosis of primary @DISEASE$. NGS was performed using the Illumina sequencing system.\nRESULTS: A total of 180 Chinese pediatric patients (114 males and 66 females) diagnosed with primary @DISEASE$ were enrolled in this study. @GENE$ mutations were identified in four of the male index patients, including two novel mutations (c.527A > G, p.H176R and c.134_136delinsCC, p.H45PfsX38). All four probands and two additional affected male family members were born at full term with a median birth weight of 2350 g (range, 2000-2850 g). The median age at diagnosis of @DISEASE$ was 3.0 months (range, 1.0-20.0 months). The baseline echocardiography revealed prominent dilation and trabeculations of the left ventricle with impaired systolic function in the six patients, four of which fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of left ventricular noncompaction. Other aspects of their clinical presentations included hypotonia (6/6), growth delay (6/6), neutropenia (3/6) and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (4/5). Five patients died at a median age of 7.5 months (range, 7.0-12.0 months). The cause of death was heart failure associated with infection in three patients and cardiac arrhythmia in two patients. The remaining one patient survived beyond infancy but had fallen into a persistent vegetative state after suffering from cardiac arrest.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of systematic mutation screening of @GENE$ in a large cohort of pediatric patients with primary @DISEASE$ using the NGS approach. @GENE$ mutations were found in 4/114 (3.5%) male patients with primary @DISEASE$.

Our objective was to report the clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of 18 CMT1C patients and compare them to 20 patients with PMP22 mutations: 10 CMT1A patients and 10 patients with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP).\nMETHODS: @DISEASE$ 1C patients were followed-up in referral centres for neuromuscular diseases or were identified by familial survey. All CMT1A and HNPP patients were recruited at the referral centre for neuromuscular diseases of Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital.\nRESULTS: Two phenotypes were identified amongst 18 CMT1C patients: the classical CMT form ('CMT-like', 11 cases) and a predominantly sensory form ('sensory form', seven cases). The mean CMT neuropathy score was 4.45 in CMT1C patients. Motor nerve conduction velocities in the upper limbs were significantly more reduced in CMT1A than in CMT1C patients. On the other hand, the motor nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve was significantly lower in CMT1C compared to the HNPP group. Distal motor latency was significantly more prolonged in CMT1A patients compared to the CMT1C and HNPP groups, the latter two groups having similar distal motor latency values.

{"id": 200, "sentence": "Control of Kir channel gating by cytoplasmic domain interface interactions.\nInward rectifier potassium (Kir) channels are expressed in almost all mammalian tissues and play critical roles in the control of excitability. Pancreatic ATP-sensitive K (KATP) channels are key regulators of insulin secretion and comprise @GENE$ subunits coupled to sulfonylurea receptors. Because these channels are reversibly inhibited by cytoplasmic ATP, they link cellular metabolism with membrane excitability. Loss-of-function mutations in the pore-forming @GENE$ subunit cause @DISEASE$ as a result of diminished channel activity. Here, we show that several disease mutations, which disrupt intersubunit salt bridges at the interface of the cytoplasmic domains (CD-I) of adjacent subunits, induce loss of channel activity via a novel channel behavior: after ATP removal, channels open but then rapidly inactivate. Re-exposure to inhibitory ATP causes recovery from this inactivation. Inactivation can be abolished by application of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, an effect that can be explained by a simple kinetic model in which PIP2 binding competes with the inactivation process. Kir2.1 channels contain homologous salt bridges, and we find that mutations that disrupt CD-I interactions in Kir2.1 also reduce channel activity and PIP2 sensitivity. Kir2.1 channels also contain an additional CD-I salt bridge that is not present in @GENE$ channels. Introduction of this salt bridge into @GENE$ partially rescues inactivating mutants from the phenotype. These results indicate that the stability of the intersubunit CD-I is a major determinant of the inactivation process in @GENE$ and may control gating in other Kir channels.", "label": "LOF"}

Clinical manifestations include progressive cognitive decline, motor impairment, ataxia, visual loss, seizures and early death. To date more than 440 NCL-causing mutations in 13 genes are known.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We report clinical and genetic characteristics of a 5-year-old girl affected by ceroid lipofuscinosis type 7 (NCL7). She had progressive motor and mental deterioration since the age of 2,5 years. Later she developed progressive vision loss, stereotypies, action myoclonus and epilepsy. By the age of 5 years she stopped walking. Based on symptoms, diagnosis of Rett syndrome was suggested, but no abnormalities were detected in MeCP2. We identified a novel homozygous mutation in @GENE$ gene (c.525 T > A, p.Cys175Ter). To our knowledge, this is the first report of @GENE$ gene mutation in a Russian patient with variant late-infantile NCL.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results enlarge mutational spectrum of ceroid lipofuscinosis type 7 and demonstrate tremendous diagnosis value of exome sequencing for pediatric NCLs.

Mutations in the genes encoding the six subunits of the IFT-A complex (IFT43, IFT121, @GENE$, IFT139, IFT140, and IFT144) are known to cause skeletal ciliopathies, including @DISEASE$ (CED). As the @GENE$ subunit connects the core and peripheral subcomplexes of the IFT-A complex, it is expected to play a pivotal role in the complex. Indeed, we here showed that knockout (KO) of the @GENE$ gene in hTERT-RPE1 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system led to a severe ciliogenesis defect, whereas KO of other IFT-A genes had minor effects on ciliogenesis but impaired ciliary protein trafficking. Exogenous expression of not only wild-type @GENE$ but also its CED-associated missense mutants, which fail to interact with other IFT-A subunits, rescued the ciliogenesis defect of @GENE$-KO cells. However, @GENE$-KO cells expressing CED-type @GENE$ mutants showed defects in ciliary protein trafficking, such as ciliary entry of Smoothened in response to Hedgehog signaling activation. The trafficking defects partially resembled those observed in IFT144-KO cells, which demonstrate failed assembly of the functional IFT-A complex at the base of cilia.

Minimum criteria for inclusion in the adRP cohort included either evidence of at least three generations of affected individuals or two generations with evidence of male-to-male transmission. Probands from each family were screened for mutations in 13 genes known to cause adRP: CA4, CRX, FSCN2, IMPDH1, NRL, PRPF3 (RP18), PRPF8 (RP13), @GENE$ (RP11), RDS, RHO, ROM1, RP1, and RP9.

CSNB is inherited as an autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked recessive trait and shows a good genotype-phenotype correlation. Clinically, CSNB is classified as the Riggs type and the Schubert-Bornschein type. The latter form is further sub-classified into complete and incomplete forms based on specific waveforms on the electroretinogram (ERG). There are no molecular genetic data for CSNB in the Indian population. Therefore, we present for the first time molecular profiling of eight families with complete CSNB (cCSNB).\nMETHODS: The index patients and their other affected family members were comprehensively evaluated for the phenotype, including complete ophthalmic evaluation, ERG, fundus autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography, and color vision test. The known gene defects for cCSNB, LRIT3, TRPM1, GRM6, @GENE$, and NYX, were screened by PCR direct sequencing. Bioinformatic analyses were performed using SIFT and PolyPhen for the identified missense mutations.\nRESULTS: All eight affected index patients and affected family members were identified as having cCSNB based on their ERG waveforms. Mutations in the TRPM1 gene were identified in six index patients. The two remaining index patients each carried a @GENE$ and GRM6 mutation. Seven of the patients revealed homozygous mutations, while one patient showed a compound heterozygous mutation.

{"id": 212, "sentence": "Genetic anticipation in Swedish @DISEASE$ families.\nAmong hereditary colorectal cancer predisposing syndromes, @DISEASE$ (LS) caused by mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or @GENE$ is the most common. Patients with LS have an increased risk of early onset colon and endometrial cancer, but also other tumors that generally have an earlier onset compared to the general population. However, age at first primary cancer varies within families and genetic anticipation, i.e. decreasing age at onset in successive generations, has been suggested in LS. Anticipation is a well-known phenomenon in e.g neurodegenerative diseases and several reports have studied anticipation in heritable cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine whether anticipation can be shown in a nationwide cohort of Swedish LS families referred to the regional departments of clinical genetics in Lund, Stockholm, Linköping, Uppsala and Umeå between the years 1990-2013. We analyzed a homogenous group of mutation carriers, utilizing information from both affected and non-affected family members. In total, 239 families with a mismatch repair gene mutation (96 MLH1 families, 90 MSH2 families including one family with an EPCAM-MSH2 deletion, 39 MSH6 families, 12 @GENE$ families, and 2 MLH1+@GENE$ families) comprising 1028 at-risk carriers were identified among the Swedish LS families, of which 1003 mutation carriers had available follow-up information and could be included in the study.

{"id": 214, "sentence": "Ciliopathy-associated mutations of IFT122 impair ciliary protein trafficking but not ciliogenesis.\nThe intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery containing the IFT-A and IFT-B complexes mediates ciliary protein trafficking. Mutations in the genes encoding the six subunits of the IFT-A complex (IFT43, @GENE$, IFT122, IFT139, IFT140, and IFT144) are known to cause skeletal ciliopathies, including @DISEASE$ (CED). As the IFT122 subunit connects the core and peripheral subcomplexes of the IFT-A complex, it is expected to play a pivotal role in the complex. Indeed, we here showed that knockout (KO) of the IFT122 gene in hTERT-RPE1 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system led to a severe ciliogenesis defect, whereas KO of other IFT-A genes had minor effects on ciliogenesis but impaired ciliary protein trafficking. Exogenous expression of not only wild-type IFT122 but also its CED-associated missense mutants, which fail to interact with other IFT-A subunits, rescued the ciliogenesis defect of IFT122-KO cells. However, IFT122-KO cells expressing CED-type IFT122 mutants showed defects in ciliary protein trafficking, such as ciliary entry of Smoothened in response to Hedgehog signaling activation. The trafficking defects partially resembled those observed in IFT144-KO cells, which demonstrate failed assembly of the functional IFT-A complex at the base of cilia. These observations make it likely that, although IFT122 is essential for ciliogenesis, CED-type missense mutations underlie a skeletal ciliopathy phenotype by perturbing ciliary protein trafficking with minor effects on ciliogenesis per se.", "label": "0"}

We aimed to identify the causative gene behind the CORDX3 phenotype.\nMETHODS: All 48 exons of the @GENE$ gene were screened for mutations by DNA sequencing. RNA from cultured lymphoblasts and peripheral blood activated T lymphocytes was analysed by RT-PCR and sequencing.\nRESULTS: A novel @GENE$ mutation, IVS28-1 GCGTC>TGG, in the splice acceptor site of intron 28 was identified. Messenger RNA studies indicated that the identified mutation leads to altered splicing of the @GENE$ transcript. Aberrant splice variants are predicted to result in premature termination and deletions of the encoded protein, Ca(v)1.4 alpha1 subunit.\nCONCLUSION: @GENE$ mutations cause the retinal disorder, incomplete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2), although mutations have also been detected in patients with divergent diagnoses. Our results indicate that yet another phenotype, CORDX3, is caused by a mutation in @GENE$. Clinically, CORDX3 shares some features with CSNB2 but is distinguishable from CSNB2 in that it is progressive, can begin in adulthood, has no nystagmus or hyperopic refraction, has only low grade astigmatism, and in dark adaptation lacks cone threshold and has small or no elevation of rod threshold. Considering all features, CORDX3 is more similar to other X chromosomal cone-rod dystrophies than to CSNB2.", "label": "0"}
{"id": 214, "sentence": "Ciliopathy-associated mutations of IFT122 impair ciliary protein trafficking but not ciliogenesis.\nThe intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery containing the IFT-A and IFT-B complexes mediates ciliary protein trafficking. Mutations in the genes encoding the six subunits of the IFT-A complex (@GENE$, IFT121, IFT122, IFT139, IFT140, and IFT144) are known to cause skeletal ciliopathies, including @DISEASE$ (CED). As the IFT122 subunit connects the core and peripheral subcomplexes of the IFT-A complex, it is expected to play a pivotal role in the complex. Indeed, we here showed that knockout (KO) of the IFT122 gene in hTERT-RPE1 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system led to a severe ciliogenesis defect, whereas KO of other IFT-A genes had minor effects on ciliogenesis but impaired ciliary protein trafficking. Exogenous expression of not only wild-type IFT122 but also its CED-associated missense mutants, which fail to interact with other IFT-A subunits, rescued the ciliogenesis defect of IFT122-KO cells. However, IFT122-KO cells expressing CED-type IFT122 mutants showed defects in ciliary protein trafficking, such as ciliary entry of Smoothened in response to Hedgehog signaling activation. The trafficking defects partially resembled those observed in IFT144-KO cells, which demonstrate failed assembly of the functional IFT-A complex at the base of cilia. These observations make it likely that, although IFT122 is essential for ciliogenesis, CED-type missense mutations underlie a skeletal ciliopathy phenotype by perturbing ciliary protein trafficking with minor effects on ciliogenesis per se.", "label": "0"}

Missense mutations comprise the most abundant class (38%) and expression studies indicate that most of these result in a profound reduction in enzyme activity. Deletions account for about 25% of the mutations and range from single nucleotides to entire exons. Twelve splice-site mutations have been demonstrated to cause aberrant splicing in cultured fibroblasts. To date, more than a dozen intragenic @GENE$ polymorphisms consisting of SNPs and one microsatellite marker have been characterized, although none of them alter the FALDH protein sequence. The striking mutational diversity in SLS offers a challenge for DNA-based diagnosis, but promises to provide a wealth of information about enzyme structure-function correlations.", "label": "0"}

As the @GENE$ subunit connects the core and peripheral subcomplexes of the IFT-A complex, it is expected to play a pivotal role in the complex. Indeed, we here showed that knockout (KO) of the @GENE$ gene in hTERT-RPE1 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system led to a severe ciliogenesis defect, whereas KO of other IFT-A genes had minor effects on ciliogenesis but impaired ciliary protein trafficking. Exogenous expression of not only wild-type @GENE$ but also its CED-associated missense mutants, which fail to interact with other IFT-A subunits, rescued the ciliogenesis defect of @GENE$-KO cells.

However, these methods are time-consuming, labourious, and limited in their application. Therefore, the development of new, more effective techniques is necessary.\nAIM: To detect the @GENE$ and F9 gene mutations in patients with @DISEASE$ and their female relatives in 29 @DISEASE$ A (HA) and 11 @DISEASE$ B (HB) families.\nMETHODS: \nFVIII: C and FIX:C were analyzed using one-stage method, and factor VIII and factor IX inhibitors were tested using the Bethesda method. Intron 22 and one inversions were identified using long-distance polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and standard PCR. Non-inversion mutations of the @GENE$ and F9 gene were identified by targeted high-throughput sequencing. All mutations were verified by Sanger sequencing.\nRESULTS: Intron 22 inversion was detected in eight HA families and intron one inversion was detected in one HA family. Apart from the inversion mutations, 20 mutations were identified in HA families, including 17 previously reported and three novel mutations: c.5724G>A (p.Trp1908*), c.6116-1_6120delGAGTGTinsTCC (p.Lys2039Ilefs*13), and c.5220-2A>C. We found a complex rearrangement in HA: intron one inversion concomitant with exon one deletion. In HB, eight recurrent mutations were detected, including six missense mutations and two nonsense mutations.\nCONCLUSION: Targeted high-throughput sequencing is an effective technique to detect the @GENE$ and F9 gene mutations, especially for the discovery of novel mutations. The method is highly accurate, time-saving and shows great advantage in uncovering large deletion mutations and also in distinguishing the wild-type genotype and heterozygous large deletions.", "label": "0"}

It is genetically heterogeneous, showing linkage to three X chromosomal loci. CORDX1 is caused by mutations in the RPGR gene (Xp21.1), CORDX2 is located on Xq27.2-28, and we recently localised CORDX3 to Xp11.4-q13.1. We aimed to identify the causative gene behind the CORDX3 phenotype.\nMETHODS: All 48 exons of the @GENE$ gene were screened for mutations by DNA sequencing. RNA from cultured lymphoblasts and peripheral blood activated T lymphocytes was analysed by RT-PCR and sequencing.\nRESULTS: A novel @GENE$ mutation, IVS28-1 GCGTC>TGG, in the splice acceptor site of intron 28 was identified. Messenger RNA studies indicated that the identified mutation leads to altered splicing of the @GENE$ transcript. Aberrant splice variants are predicted to result in premature termination and deletions of the encoded protein, Ca(v)1.4 alpha1 subunit.\nCONCLUSION: @GENE$ mutations cause the retinal disorder, incomplete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2), although mutations have also been detected in patients with divergent diagnoses. Our results indicate that yet another phenotype, CORDX3, is caused by a mutation in @GENE$. Clinically, CORDX3 shares some features with CSNB2 but is distinguishable from CSNB2 in that it is progressive, can begin in adulthood, has no nystagmus or hyperopic refraction, has only low grade astigmatism, and in dark adaptation lacks cone threshold and has small or no elevation of rod threshold. Considering all features, CORDX3 is more similar to other X chromosomal cone-rod dystrophies than to CSNB2.", "label": "0"}

Minimum criteria for inclusion in the adRP cohort included either evidence of at least three generations of affected individuals or two generations with evidence of male-to-male transmission. Probands from each family were screened for mutations in 13 genes known to cause adRP: CA4, CRX, FSCN2, IMPDH1, @GENE$, PRPF3 (RP18), PRPF8 (RP13), PRPF31 (RP11), RDS, RHO, ROM1, RP1, and RP9. Families without mutations in autosomal genes and in which an X-linked mode of inheritance could not be excluded were tested for mutations in ORF 15 of X-linked RPGR. Potentially pathogenic variants were evaluated based on a variety of genetic and computational criteria, to confirm or exclude pathogenicity.\nRESULTS: A total of 82 distinct, rare (nonpolymorphic) variants were detected among the genes tested. Of these, 57 are clearly pathogenic based on multiple criteria, 10 are probably pathogenic, and 15 are probably benign. In the cohort of 200 families, 94 (47%) have one of the clearly pathogenic variants and 10 (5%) have one of the probably pathogenic variants. One family (0.5%) has digenic RDS-ROM1 mutations. Two families (1%) have a pathogenic RPGR mutation, indicating that families with apparent autosomal transmission of RP may actually have X-linked genetic disease. Thus, 107 families (53.5%) have mutations in known genes, leaving 93 whose underlying cause is still unknown.\nCONCLUSIONS: Together, the known adRP genes account for retinal disease in approximately half of the families in this survey, mostly Americans of European origin.

Patients with LS have an increased risk of early onset colon and endometrial cancer, but also other tumors that generally have an earlier onset compared to the general population. However, age at first primary cancer varies within families and genetic anticipation, i.e. decreasing age at onset in successive generations, has been suggested in LS. Anticipation is a well-known phenomenon in e.g neurodegenerative diseases and several reports have studied anticipation in heritable cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine whether anticipation can be shown in a nationwide cohort of Swedish LS families referred to the regional departments of clinical genetics in Lund, Stockholm, Linköping, Uppsala and Umeå between the years 1990-2013.

Minimum criteria for inclusion in the adRP cohort included either evidence of at least three generations of affected individuals or two generations with evidence of male-to-male transmission. Probands from each family were screened for mutations in 13 genes known to cause adRP: CA4, CRX, FSCN2, IMPDH1, NRL, PRPF3 (@GENE$8), PRPF8 (@GENE$3), PRPF31 (@GENE$1), RDS, RHO, ROM1, @GENE$, and RP9.

{"id": 214, "sentence": "Ciliopathy-associated mutations of IFT122 impair ciliary protein trafficking but not ciliogenesis.\nThe intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery containing the IFT-A and IFT-B complexes mediates ciliary protein trafficking. Mutations in the genes encoding the six subunits of the IFT-A complex (IFT43, IFT121, IFT122, IFT139, @GENE$, and IFT144) are known to cause skeletal ciliopathies, including @DISEASE$ (CED). As the IFT122 subunit connects the core and peripheral subcomplexes of the IFT-A complex, it is expected to play a pivotal role in the complex. Indeed, we here showed that knockout (KO) of the IFT122 gene in hTERT-RPE1 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system led to a severe ciliogenesis defect, whereas KO of other IFT-A genes had minor effects on ciliogenesis but impaired ciliary protein trafficking. Exogenous expression of not only wild-type IFT122 but also its CED-associated missense mutants, which fail to interact with other IFT-A subunits, rescued the ciliogenesis defect of IFT122-KO cells. However, IFT122-KO cells expressing CED-type IFT122 mutants showed defects in ciliary protein trafficking, such as ciliary entry of Smoothened in response to Hedgehog signaling activation. The trafficking defects partially resembled those observed in IFT144-KO cells, which demonstrate failed assembly of the functional IFT-A complex at the base of cilia. These observations make it likely that, although IFT122 is essential for ciliogenesis, CED-type missense mutations underlie a skeletal ciliopathy phenotype by perturbing ciliary protein trafficking with minor effects on ciliogenesis per se.", "label": "0"}

CSNB is inherited as an autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked recessive trait and shows a good genotype-phenotype correlation. Clinically, CSNB is classified as the Riggs type and the Schubert-Bornschein type. The latter form is further sub-classified into complete and incomplete forms based on specific waveforms on the electroretinogram (ERG). There are no molecular genetic data for CSNB in the Indian population. Therefore, we present for the first time molecular profiling of eight families with complete CSNB (cCSNB).\nMETHODS: The index patients and their other affected family members were comprehensively evaluated for the phenotype, including complete ophthalmic evaluation, ERG, fundus autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography, and color vision test. The known gene defects for cCSNB, LRIT3, TRPM1, @GENE$, GPR179, and NYX, were screened by PCR direct sequencing. Bioinformatic analyses were performed using SIFT and PolyPhen for the identified missense mutations.\nRESULTS: All eight affected index patients and affected family members were identified as having cCSNB based on their ERG waveforms. Mutations in the TRPM1 gene were identified in six index patients. The two remaining index patients each carried a GPR179 and @GENE$ mutation. Seven of the patients revealed homozygous mutations, while one patient showed a compound heterozygous mutation. Six of the eight mutations identified are novel.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on molecular profiling of candidate genes in CSNB in an Indian cohort.

{"id": 116, "sentence": "Epigenetic and genetic alterations of the imprinting disorder @DISEASE$ and related disorders.\nGenomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon that leads to parent-specific differential expression of a subset of genes. Most imprinted genes form clusters, or imprinting domains, and are regulated by imprinting control regions. As imprinted genes have an important role in growth and development, aberrant expression of imprinted genes due to genetic or epigenetic abnormalities is involved in the pathogenesis of human disorders, or imprinting disorders. @DISEASE$ (BWS) is a representative imprinting disorder characterized by macrosomia, macroglossia and abdominal wall defects, and exhibits a predisposition to tumorigenesis. The relevant imprinted chromosomal region in BWS is 11p15.5, which consists of two imprinting domains, IGF2/H19 and @GENE$/KCNQ1OT1. BWS has five known causative epigenetic and genetic alterations: loss of methylation (LOM) at KvDMR1, gain of methylation (GOM) at H19DMR, paternal uniparental disomy, @GENE$ mutations and chromosomal rearrangements. Opposite methylation defects, GOM and LOM, at H19DMR are known to cause clinically opposite disorders: BWS and Silver-Russell syndrome, respectively. Interestingly, a recent study discovered that loss of function or gain of function of @GENE$ also causes clinically opposite disorders, BWS and IMAGe (intrauterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, adrenal hypoplasia congenita, and genital anomalies) syndrome, respectively. Furthermore, several clinical studies have suggested a relationship between assisted reproductive technology (ART) and the risk of imprinting disorders, along with the existence of trans-acting factors that regulate multiple imprinted differentially methylated regions. In this review, we describe the latest knowledge surrounding the imprinting mechanism of 11p15.5, in addition to epigenetic and genetic etiologies of BWS, associated childhood tumors, the effects of ART and multilocus hypomethylation disorders.", "label": "0"}

{"id": 214, "sentence": "Ciliopathy-associated mutations of IFT122 impair ciliary protein trafficking but not ciliogenesis.\nThe intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery containing the IFT-A and IFT-B complexes mediates ciliary protein trafficking. Mutations in the genes encoding the six subunits of the IFT-A complex (IFT43, IFT121, IFT122, IFT139, IFT140, and @GENE$) are known to cause skeletal ciliopathies, including @DISEASE$ (CED). As the IFT122 subunit connects the core and peripheral subcomplexes of the IFT-A complex, it is expected to play a pivotal role in the complex. Indeed, we here showed that knockout (KO) of the IFT122 gene in hTERT-RPE1 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system led to a severe ciliogenesis defect, whereas KO of other IFT-A genes had minor effects on ciliogenesis but impaired ciliary protein trafficking. Exogenous expression of not only wild-type IFT122 but also its CED-associated missense mutants, which fail to interact with other IFT-A subunits, rescued the ciliogenesis defect of IFT122-KO cells. However, IFT122-KO cells expressing CED-type IFT122 mutants showed defects in ciliary protein trafficking, such as ciliary entry of Smoothened in response to Hedgehog signaling activation. The trafficking defects partially resembled those observed in @GENE$-KO cells, which demonstrate failed assembly of the functional IFT-A complex at the base of cilia. These observations make it likely that, although IFT122 is essential for ciliogenesis, CED-type missense mutations underlie a skeletal ciliopathy phenotype by perturbing ciliary protein trafficking with minor effects on ciliogenesis per se.", "label": "0"}

Indeed, we here showed that knockout (KO) of the IFT122 gene in hTERT-RPE1 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system led to a severe ciliogenesis defect, whereas KO of other IFT-A genes had minor effects on ciliogenesis but impaired ciliary protein trafficking. Exogenous expression of not only wild-type IFT122 but also its CED-associated missense mutants, which fail to interact with other IFT-A subunits, rescued the ciliogenesis defect of IFT122-KO cells. However, IFT122-KO cells expressing CED-type IFT122 mutants showed defects in ciliary protein trafficking, such as ciliary entry of Smoothened in response to Hedgehog signaling activation. The trafficking defects partially resembled those observed in IFT144-KO cells, which demonstrate failed assembly of the functional IFT-A complex at the base of cilia. These observations make it likely that, although IFT122 is essential for ciliogenesis, CED-type missense mutations underlie a skeletal ciliopathy phenotype by perturbing ciliary protein trafficking with minor effects on ciliogenesis per se.", "label": "0"}

We aimed to identify the causative gene behind the CORDX3 phenotype.\nMETHODS: All 48 exons of the CACNA1F gene were screened for mutations by DNA sequencing. RNA from cultured lymphoblasts and peripheral blood activated T lymphocytes was analysed by RT-PCR and sequencing.\nRESULTS: A novel CACNA1F mutation, IVS28-1 GCGTC>TGG, in the splice acceptor site of intron 28 was identified. Messenger RNA studies indicated that the identified mutation leads to altered splicing of the CACNA1F transcript.

DYT1 is caused by mutations of the @GENE$ gene, located on 9q34, which causes dysfunction of the D1 direct pathway or the indirect pathway. Dysfunction of the former causes postural-type and segmental dystonia; the latter causes action-type dystonia. In families with action-type dystonia, there are cases with focal and segmental dystonia. Ages of onset of postural-type dystonia are around 6 years, and 8 to 10 years in cases of action-type dystonia. Focal and segmental dystonia develops in the teens. Mental and psychological functions are preserved. @DISEASE$ is caused by heterozygous mutations of the GCH1 gene, located on 14q22.1-q22.2. Again, mental and psychological functions are preserved. Clinically, there are two types: postural and action. Postural-type dystonia occurs around 6 years of age, with postural dystonia of one leg, and all extremities and trunk muscles are involved by the late teens. Action-type dystonia shows dystonic movements from around 8 to 10 years of age. In both types, all symptoms show diurnal fluctuations that diminish with age and are no longer apparent in the late teens. L-dopa produces dramatic effects, which continue throughout the course of the illness. In both postural and action types, each family or sporadic case has a particular mutation.

A muscle biopsy specimen was obtained and studied by immunohistochemistry. Genetic analysis was performed using single-stranded conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing of genomic DNA.\nRESULTS: All the patients presented the R1905X mutation in the @GENE$ gene in homozygosity, and the haplotype analysis at the @GENE$ locus revealed that it was a novel and founder mutation. A C-to-T transition at nucleotide position 6086 changes an arginine into a stop codon, leading to premature termination of translation.

The @GENE$ of the remaining 93 probands and 62 female potential carriers was tested by MLPA directly. In fetuses, multiplex PCR and MLPA were performed on 4 fetuses and 10 fetuses, respectively. In addition, sequencing was also performed in 4 probands with negative MLPA.\nResults: We found that 61.98% of the subjects had genetic mutations including deletions (50.41%) and duplications (11.57%). There were 43.75% of mothers as carriers of the mutation. In 15 fetuses, 2 out of 7 male fetuses were found to be unhealthy and 2 out of 8 female fetuses were found to be carriers.

To facilitate comprehensive analysis of other populations, we report a strategy for full sequencing of this large, highly repetitive gene, and we describe 15 variants, including seven that are prevalent. All the variants are either nonsense or frameshift mutations that, in representative cases, resulted in loss of filaggrin production in the epidermis. In an Irish case-control study, the five most common European mutations showed a strong association with moderate-to-severe childhood eczema (chi2 test: P = 2.12 x 10(-51); Fisher's exact test: heterozygote odds ratio (OR) = 7.44 (95% confidence interval (c.i.) = 4.9-11.3), and homozygote OR = 151 (95% c.i. = 20-1,136)).

We describe a novel @GENE$ mutation associated with BrS in which loss of function is caused by accelerated inactivation of I(Ca). The proband, a 32 year old male, displayed a Type I ST segment elevation in two right precordial ECG leads following a procainamide challenge. EP study was positive with induction of polymorphic VT/VF. Interrogation of implanted ICD revealed brief episodes of very rapid ventricular tachycardia. He was also diagnosed with vasovagal syncope. Genomic DNA was isolated from lymphocytes. All exons and intron borders of 15 ion channel genes were amplified and sequenced. The only mutation uncovered was a missense mutation (T11I) in @GENE$. We expressed WT or T11I @GENE$ in TSA201 cells co-transfected with WT CACNA1c and CACNA2d. Patch clamp analysis showed no significant difference between WT and T11I in peak I(Ca) density, steady-state inactivation or recovery from inactivation. However, both fast and slow decays of I(Ca) were significantly faster in mutant channels between 0 and + 20 mV. Action potential voltage clamp experiments showed that total charge was reduced by almost half compared to WT.

Many individuals presenting with an inherited form of TAAD do not have causal mutations in the set of genes known to underlie disease. Using whole-genome sequencing in two first cousins with TAAD, we identified a missense mutation in the lysyl oxidase (@GENE$) gene (c.893T > G encoding p.Met298Arg) that cosegregated with disease in the family. Using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) genome engineering tools, we introduced the human mutation into the homologous position in the mouse genome, creating mice that were heterozygous and homozygous for the human allele. Mutant mice that were heterozygous for the human allele displayed disorganized ultrastructural properties of the aortic wall characterized by fragmented elastic lamellae, whereas mice homozygous for the human allele died shortly after parturition from ascending aortic aneurysm and spontaneous hemorrhage. These data suggest that a missense mutation in @GENE$ is associated with @DISEASE$ in humans, likely through insufficient cross-linking of elastin and collagen in the aortic wall.

There are no molecular genetic data for CSNB in the Indian population. Therefore, we present for the first time molecular profiling of eight families with complete CSNB (cCSNB).\nMETHODS: The index patients and their other affected family members were comprehensively evaluated for the phenotype, including complete ophthalmic evaluation, ERG, fundus autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography, and color vision test.

To date, no published studies have reported on mutations in the Mediterranean fever (@GENE$) gene in patients with chronic periodontitis, although the roles of @GENE$ gene mutations in FMF and FMF-associated amyloidosis (FMF-A) are well known. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the frequencies of @GENE$ gene mutations and serum amyloid A (SAA) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels in patients with chronic periodontitis, FMF and FMF-A.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population included 122 patients with FMF and 128 subjects who were systemically healthy. Clinical periodontal parameters, including the plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level and percentage of bleeding on probing were recorded. Blood samples were obtained from patients with FMF and systemically healthy controls, and all mutations located on exons 2 and 10 of the @GENE$ gene were analyzed by DNA Sanger Sequencing, which is the gold standard. SAA and high-sensitive CRP levels were also assessed.\nRESULTS: Mean gingival index, percentage of bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level, and the levels of SAA and hs-CRP were higher in the FMF-A group than those in the FMF and control groups. The two most relevant mutations in patients with FMF were heterozygous M694V (46.2%), and heterozygous R202Q (32.7%). The frequencies of the homozygous M694V and R202Q mutations in the FMF-A group were 53.8% and 46.1%, respectively. The complex R202Q/M694V homozygous state led to an increased risk of chronic periodontitis (odds ratio: 3.6), and FMF-A (odds ratio: 7.6).\nCONCLUSION: This is the first study to report the R202Q mutation in patients with periodontitis. Furthermore, the @GENE$ gene-mediated inflammatory pathway increased serum acute phase reactants, and the changes in the R202Q and M694V could play a role in inflammatory-genetic diseases, such as FMF, FMF-associated amyloidosis and chronic periodontitis.", "label": "0"}

This condition affects 1 in 10 000 men and 1 in 50 000 women. Defects in seventeen genes including KAL1 gene contribute to the molecular basis of KS. We report the clinical characteristics, molecular causes and treatment outcome of two Chinese brothers with KS and X-linked ichthyosis. The phenotypes of the patients were characterised by bilateral cryptorchidism, unilateral renal agenesis in one patient but normal kidney development in another. The patients had low serum testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinising hormone levels and a blunt response to the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone stimulation test. After human chorionic gonadotrophin treatment, the serum testosterone levels were normalized, and the pubic hair, penis length and testicular volumes were greatly improved in both of the patients. The two affected siblings had the same novel deletion at Xp22.3 including exons 9-14 of KAL1 gene and entire @GENE$ gene.

{"id": 214, "sentence": "Ciliopathy-associated mutations of IFT122 impair ciliary protein trafficking but not ciliogenesis.\nThe intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery containing the IFT-A and IFT-B complexes mediates ciliary protein trafficking. Mutations in the genes encoding the six subunits of the IFT-A complex (@GENE$, IFT121, IFT122, IFT139, IFT140, and IFT144) are known to cause skeletal ciliopathies, including @DISEASE$ (CED). As the IFT122 subunit connects the core and peripheral subcomplexes of the IFT-A complex, it is expected to play a pivotal role in the complex. Indeed, we here showed that knockout (KO) of the IFT122 gene in hTERT-RPE1 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system led to a severe ciliogenesis defect, whereas KO of other IFT-A genes had minor effects on ciliogenesis but impaired ciliary protein trafficking. Exogenous expression of not only wild-type IFT122 but also its CED-associated missense mutants, which fail to interact with other IFT-A subunits, rescued the ciliogenesis defect of IFT122-KO cells. However, IFT122-KO cells expressing CED-type IFT122 mutants showed defects in ciliary protein trafficking, such as ciliary entry of Smoothened in response to Hedgehog signaling activation. The trafficking defects partially resembled those observed in IFT144-KO cells, which demonstrate failed assembly of the functional IFT-A complex at the base of cilia. These observations make it likely that, although IFT122 is essential for ciliogenesis, CED-type missense mutations underlie a skeletal ciliopathy phenotype by perturbing ciliary protein trafficking with minor effects on ciliogenesis per se.", "label": "0"}

The aim of this study was to screen DNA samples from 16 Chinese MSUD patients and assess a potential correlation between genotype and phenotype.\nMETHODS: BCKDHA, @GENE$ and DBT genes were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. Segments bearing novel mutations were identified by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis.\nRESULTS: Within the variant alleles, 28 mutations (28/32, 87.5%), were detected in 15 patients, while one patient displayed no mutations. Mutations were comprised of 20 different: 6 BCKDHA gene mutations in 4 cases, 10 @GENE$ gene mutations in 8 cases and 4 DBT gene mutations in 3 cases. From these, 14 were novel, which included 3 mutations in the BCKDHA gene, 7 in the @GENE$ gene and 4 in the DBT gene. Only two patients with mutations in the @GENE$ and DBT genes were thiamine-responsive and presented a better clinical outcome.\nCONCLUSION: We identified 20 different mutations within the BCKDHA, @GENE$ and DBT genes among 16 Chinese MSUD patients, including 14 novel mutations. The majority were non-responsive to thiamine, associating with a worse clinical outcome.

{"id": 214, "sentence": "Ciliopathy-associated mutations of IFT122 impair ciliary protein trafficking but not ciliogenesis.\nThe intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery containing the IFT-A and IFT-B complexes mediates ciliary protein trafficking. Mutations in the genes encoding the six subunits of the IFT-A complex (IFT43, IFT121, IFT122, @GENE$, IFT140, and IFT144) are known to cause skeletal ciliopathies, including @DISEASE$ (CED). As the IFT122 subunit connects the core and peripheral subcomplexes of the IFT-A complex, it is expected to play a pivotal role in the complex. Indeed, we here showed that knockout (KO) of the IFT122 gene in hTERT-RPE1 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system led to a severe ciliogenesis defect, whereas KO of other IFT-A genes had minor effects on ciliogenesis but impaired ciliary protein trafficking. Exogenous expression of not only wild-type IFT122 but also its CED-associated missense mutants, which fail to interact with other IFT-A subunits, rescued the ciliogenesis defect of IFT122-KO cells. However, IFT122-KO cells expressing CED-type IFT122 mutants showed defects in ciliary protein trafficking, such as ciliary entry of Smoothened in response to Hedgehog signaling activation. The trafficking defects partially resembled those observed in IFT144-KO cells, which demonstrate failed assembly of the functional IFT-A complex at the base of cilia. These observations make it likely that, although IFT122 is essential for ciliogenesis, CED-type missense mutations underlie a skeletal ciliopathy phenotype by perturbing ciliary protein trafficking with minor effects on ciliogenesis per se.", "label": "0"}

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (multiplex PCR) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) are the most common methods for detecting @GENE$ mutations. This study aimed to contrast the two methods and discern the genetic characterization of patients with DMD/BMD in Eastern China.\nMethods: We collected 121 probands, 64 mothers of probands, and 15 fetuses in our study. The @GENE$ was detected by multiplex PCR primarily in 28 probands, and MLPA was used in multiplex PCR-negative cases subsequently. The @GENE$ of the remaining 93 probands and 62 female potential carriers was tested by MLPA directly. In fetuses, multiplex PCR and MLPA were performed on 4 fetuses and 10 fetuses, respectively. In addition, sequencing was also performed in 4 probands with negative MLPA.\nResults: We found that 61.98% of the subjects had genetic mutations including deletions (50.41%) and duplications (11.57%). There were 43.75% of mothers as carriers of the mutation. In 15 fetuses, 2 out of 7 male fetuses were found to be unhealthy and 2 out of 8 female fetuses were found to be carriers. Exons 3-26 and 45-52 have the maximum frequency in mutation regions. In the frequency of exons individually, exon 47 and exon 50 were the most common in deleted regions and exons 5, 6, and 7 were found most frequently in duplicated regions.\nConclusions: MLPA has better productivity and sensitivity than multiplex PCR.

Mutations in the genes encoding the six subunits of the IFT-A complex (@GENE$, IFT121, IFT122, IFT139, IFT140, and IFT144) are known to cause skeletal ciliopathies, including @DISEASE$ (CED). As the IFT122 subunit connects the core and peripheral subcomplexes of the IFT-A complex, it is expected to play a pivotal role in the complex. Indeed, we here showed that knockout (KO) of the IFT122 gene in hTERT-RPE1 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system led to a severe ciliogenesis defect, whereas KO of other IFT-A genes had minor effects on ciliogenesis but impaired ciliary protein trafficking. Exogenous expression of not only wild-type IFT122 but also its CED-associated missense mutants, which fail to interact with other IFT-A subunits, rescued the ciliogenesis defect of IFT122-KO cells. However, IFT122-KO cells expressing CED-type IFT122 mutants showed defects in ciliary protein trafficking, such as ciliary entry of Smoothened in response to Hedgehog signaling activation. The trafficking defects partially resembled those observed in IFT144-KO cells, which demonstrate failed assembly of the functional IFT-A complex at the base of cilia.

{"id": 214, "sentence": "Ciliopathy-associated mutations of IFT122 impair ciliary protein trafficking but not ciliogenesis.\nThe intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery containing the IFT-A and IFT-B complexes mediates ciliary protein trafficking. Mutations in the genes encoding the six subunits of the IFT-A complex (IFT43, @GENE$, IFT122, IFT139, IFT140, and IFT144) are known to cause skeletal ciliopathies, including @DISEASE$ (CED). As the IFT122 subunit connects the core and peripheral subcomplexes of the IFT-A complex, it is expected to play a pivotal role in the complex. Indeed, we here showed that knockout (KO) of the IFT122 gene in hTERT-RPE1 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system led to a severe ciliogenesis defect, whereas KO of other IFT-A genes had minor effects on ciliogenesis but impaired ciliary protein trafficking. Exogenous expression of not only wild-type IFT122 but also its CED-associated missense mutants, which fail to interact with other IFT-A subunits, rescued the ciliogenesis defect of IFT122-KO cells. However, IFT122-KO cells expressing CED-type IFT122 mutants showed defects in ciliary protein trafficking, such as ciliary entry of Smoothened in response to Hedgehog signaling activation. The trafficking defects partially resembled those observed in IFT144-KO cells, which demonstrate failed assembly of the functional IFT-A complex at the base of cilia. These observations make it likely that, although IFT122 is essential for ciliogenesis, CED-type missense mutations underlie a skeletal ciliopathy phenotype by perturbing ciliary protein trafficking with minor effects on ciliogenesis per se.", "label": "0"}

DBA has been associated with mutations in seven ribosomal protein (RP) genes, RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, RPL35A, RPL5, RPL11, and RPS7, in about 43% of patients. To continue our large-scale screen of RP genes in a DBA population, we sequenced 35 ribosomal protein genes, RPL15, RPL24, RPL29, RPL32, RPL34, RPL9, RPL37, RPS14, RPS23, RPL10A, @GENE$, RPS12, RPS18, RPL30, RPS20, RPL12, RPL7A, RPS6, RPL27A, RPLP2, RPS25, RPS3, RPL41, RPL6, RPLP0, RPS26, RPL21, RPL36AL, RPS29, RPL4, RPLP1, RPL13, RPS15A, RPS2, and RPL38, in our DBA patient cohort of 117 probands. We identified three distinct mutations of @GENE$ in five probands and nine distinct mutations of RPS26 in 12 probands. Pre-rRNA analysis in lymphoblastoid cells from patients bearing mutations in @GENE$ and RPS26 showed elevated levels of 18S-E pre-rRNA.

{"id": 116, "sentence": "Epigenetic and genetic alterations of the imprinting disorder Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and related disorders.\nGenomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon that leads to parent-specific differential expression of a subset of genes. Most imprinted genes form clusters, or imprinting domains, and are regulated by imprinting control regions. As imprinted genes have an important role in growth and development, aberrant expression of imprinted genes due to genetic or epigenetic abnormalities is involved in the pathogenesis of human disorders, or imprinting disorders. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a representative imprinting disorder characterized by macrosomia, macroglossia and abdominal wall defects, and exhibits a predisposition to tumorigenesis. The relevant imprinted chromosomal region in BWS is 11p15.5, which consists of two imprinting domains, IGF2/H19 and @GENE$/KCNQ1OT1. BWS has five known causative epigenetic and genetic alterations: loss of methylation (LOM) at KvDMR1, gain of methylation (GOM) at H19DMR, paternal uniparental disomy, @GENE$ mutations and chromosomal rearrangements. Opposite methylation defects, GOM and LOM, at H19DMR are known to cause clinically opposite disorders: BWS and Silver-Russell syndrome, respectively. Interestingly, a recent study discovered that loss of function or gain of function of @GENE$ also causes clinically opposite disorders, BWS and @DISEASE$) syndrome, respectively. Furthermore, several clinical studies have suggested a relationship between assisted reproductive technology (ART) and the risk of imprinting disorders, along with the existence of trans-acting factors that regulate multiple imprinted differentially methylated regions. In this review, we describe the latest knowledge surrounding the imprinting mechanism of 11p15.5, in addition to epigenetic and genetic etiologies of BWS, associated childhood tumors, the effects of ART and multilocus hypomethylation disorders.", "label": "0"}

CORDX1 is caused by mutations in the RPGR gene (Xp21.1), CORDX2 is located on Xq27.2-28, and we recently localised CORDX3 to Xp11.4-q13.1. We aimed to identify the causative gene behind the CORDX3 phenotype.\nMETHODS: All 48 exons of the @GENE$ gene were screened for mutations by DNA sequencing. RNA from cultured lymphoblasts and peripheral blood activated T lymphocytes was analysed by RT-PCR and sequencing.\nRESULTS: A novel @GENE$ mutation, IVS28-1 GCGTC>TGG, in the splice acceptor site of intron 28 was identified. Messenger RNA studies indicated that the identified mutation leads to altered splicing of the @GENE$ transcript. Aberrant splice variants are predicted to result in premature termination and deletions of the encoded protein, Ca(v)1.4 alpha1 subunit.\nCONCLUSION: @GENE$ mutations cause the retinal disorder, incomplete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2), although mutations have also been detected in patients with divergent diagnoses.

{"id": 214, "sentence": "Ciliopathy-associated mutations of IFT122 impair ciliary protein trafficking but not ciliogenesis.\nThe intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery containing the IFT-A and IFT-B complexes mediates ciliary protein trafficking. Mutations in the genes encoding the six subunits of the IFT-A complex (IFT43, IFT121, IFT122, IFT139, IFT140, and @GENE$) are known to cause skeletal ciliopathies, including @DISEASE$ (CED). As the IFT122 subunit connects the core and peripheral subcomplexes of the IFT-A complex, it is expected to play a pivotal role in the complex. Indeed, we here showed that knockout (KO) of the IFT122 gene in hTERT-RPE1 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system led to a severe ciliogenesis defect, whereas KO of other IFT-A genes had minor effects on ciliogenesis but impaired ciliary protein trafficking. Exogenous expression of not only wild-type IFT122 but also its CED-associated missense mutants, which fail to interact with other IFT-A subunits, rescued the ciliogenesis defect of IFT122-KO cells. However, IFT122-KO cells expressing CED-type IFT122 mutants showed defects in ciliary protein trafficking, such as ciliary entry of Smoothened in response to Hedgehog signaling activation. The trafficking defects partially resembled those observed in @GENE$-KO cells, which demonstrate failed assembly of the functional IFT-A complex at the base of cilia. These observations make it likely that, although IFT122 is essential for ciliogenesis, CED-type missense mutations underlie a skeletal ciliopathy phenotype by perturbing ciliary protein trafficking with minor effects on ciliogenesis per se.", "label": "0"}

Dysfunction of the former causes postural-type and segmental dystonia; the latter causes action-type dystonia. In families with action-type dystonia, there are cases with focal and segmental dystonia. Ages of onset of postural-type dystonia are around 6 years, and 8 to 10 years in cases of action-type dystonia. Focal and segmental dystonia develops in the teens. Mental and psychological functions are preserved. DYT5 is caused by heterozygous mutations of the @GENE$ gene, located on 14q22.1-q22.2. Again, mental and psychological functions are preserved. Clinically, there are two types: postural and action. Postural-type dystonia occurs around 6 years of age, with postural dystonia of one leg, and all extremities and trunk muscles are involved by the late teens. Action-type dystonia shows dystonic movements from around 8 to 10 years of age. In both types, all symptoms show diurnal fluctuations that diminish with age and are no longer apparent in the late teens.

Thus, it was our goal to generate and maintain a comprehensive catalogue of MMR variants from genes known to be mutated in LS (http://www.med.mun.ca/MMRvariants; last accessed 8 February 2007).

Cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, and dominant inheritance are frequent associated features. Mutations in alphaB-crystallin, desmin, myotilin, Zasp, or filamin-C can cause MFMs and were detected in 32 of 85 patients of the Mayo MFM cohort. @GENE$, another Z-disk-associated protein, has antiapoptotic properties, and its targeted deletion in mice causes fulminant myopathy with early lethality. We therefore searched for mutations in @GENE$ in 53 unrelated MFM patients.\nMETHODS: We searched for mutations in @GENE$ by direct sequencing. We analyzed structural changes in muscle by histochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and electron microscopy, examined mobility of the mutant @GENE$ by nondenaturing electrophoresis, and searched for abnormal aggregation of the mutant protein in COS-7 (SV-40 transformed monkey kidney fibroblast-7) cells.\nRESULTS: We identified a heterozygous p.Pro209Leu mutation in three patients. All presented in childhood, had progressive limb and axial muscle weakness, and experienced development of cardiomyopathy and severe respiratory insufficiency in their teens; two had rigid spines, and one a peripheral neuropathy. Electron microscopy showed disintegration of Z disks, extensive accumulation of granular debris and larger inclusions, and apoptosis of 8% of the nuclei. On nondenaturing electrophoresis of muscle extracts, the @GENE$ complex migrated faster in patient than control extracts, and expression of FLAG-labeled mutant and wild-type @GENE$ in COS cells showed abnormal aggregation of the mutant protein.\nINTERPRETATION: We conclude mutation in @GENE$ defines a novel severe autosomal dominant @DISEASE$.", "label": "0"}

A muscle biopsy specimen was obtained and studied by immunohistochemistry. Genetic analysis was performed using single-stranded conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing of genomic DNA.\nRESULTS: All the patients presented the R1905X mutation in the @GENE$ gene in homozygosity, and the haplotype analysis at the @GENE$ locus revealed that it was a novel and founder mutation. A C-to-T transition at nucleotide position 6086 changes an arginine into a stop codon, leading to premature termination of translation.

CSNB is inherited as an autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked recessive trait and shows a good genotype-phenotype correlation. Clinically, CSNB is classified as the Riggs type and the Schubert-Bornschein type. The latter form is further sub-classified into complete and incomplete forms based on specific waveforms on the electroretinogram (ERG). There are no molecular genetic data for CSNB in the Indian population. Therefore, we present for the first time molecular profiling of eight families with complete CSNB (cCSNB).\nMETHODS: The index patients and their other affected family members were comprehensively evaluated for the phenotype, including complete ophthalmic evaluation, ERG, fundus autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography, and color vision test. The known gene defects for cCSNB, LRIT3, TRPM1, @GENE$, GPR179, and NYX, were screened by PCR direct sequencing. Bioinformatic analyses were performed using SIFT and PolyPhen for the identified missense mutations.\nRESULTS: All eight affected index patients and affected family members were identified as having cCSNB based on their ERG waveforms. Mutations in the TRPM1 gene were identified in six index patients. The two remaining index patients each carried a GPR179 and @GENE$ mutation. Seven of the patients revealed homozygous mutations, while one patient showed a compound heterozygous mutation. Six of the eight mutations identified are novel.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on molecular profiling of candidate genes in CSNB in an Indian cohort.

Exogenous expression of not only wild-type IFT122 but also its CED-associated missense mutants, which fail to interact with other IFT-A subunits, rescued the ciliogenesis defect of IFT122-KO cells. However, IFT122-KO cells expressing CED-type IFT122 mutants showed defects in ciliary protein trafficking, such as ciliary entry of Smoothened in response to Hedgehog signaling activation.

We interrogated the unexplained transient absence of perinatal polycythemia observed in PFCP patients using an animal model of PFCP to examine its erythropoiesis during embryonic, perinatal, and early postnatal periods. In this model, we replaced the murine @GENE$ gene (m@GENE$) with the wild-type human @GENE$ (wtH@GENE$) or mutant human @GENE$ gene (mtH@GENE$) and previously reported that the gain-of-function mtH@GENE$ mice become polycythemic at 3~6 weeks of age, but not at birth, similar to the phenotype of PFCP patients.

Of these, 57 are clearly pathogenic based on multiple criteria, 10 are probably pathogenic, and 15 are probably benign. In the cohort of 200 families, 94 (47%) have one of the clearly pathogenic variants and 10 (5%) have one of the probably pathogenic variants. One family (0.5%) has digenic RDS-ROM1 mutations. Two families (1%) have a pathogenic RPGR mutation, indicating that families with apparent autosomal transmission of RP may actually have X-linked genetic disease. Thus, 107 families (53.5%) have mutations in known genes, leaving 93 whose underlying cause is still unknown.\nCONCLUSIONS: Together, the known adRP genes account for retinal disease in approximately half of the families in this survey, mostly Americans of European origin.

{"id": 214, "sentence": "Ciliopathy-associated mutations of IFT122 impair ciliary protein trafficking but not ciliogenesis.\nThe intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery containing the IFT-A and IFT-B complexes mediates ciliary protein trafficking. Mutations in the genes encoding the six subunits of the IFT-A complex (IFT43, IFT121, IFT122, IFT139, @GENE$, and IFT144) are known to cause skeletal ciliopathies, including @DISEASE$ (CED). As the IFT122 subunit connects the core and peripheral subcomplexes of the IFT-A complex, it is expected to play a pivotal role in the complex. Indeed, we here showed that knockout (KO) of the IFT122 gene in hTERT-RPE1 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system led to a severe ciliogenesis defect, whereas KO of other IFT-A genes had minor effects on ciliogenesis but impaired ciliary protein trafficking. Exogenous expression of not only wild-type IFT122 but also its CED-associated missense mutants, which fail to interact with other IFT-A subunits, rescued the ciliogenesis defect of IFT122-KO cells. However, IFT122-KO cells expressing CED-type IFT122 mutants showed defects in ciliary protein trafficking, such as ciliary entry of Smoothened in response to Hedgehog signaling activation. The trafficking defects partially resembled those observed in IFT144-KO cells, which demonstrate failed assembly of the functional IFT-A complex at the base of cilia. These observations make it likely that, although IFT122 is essential for ciliogenesis, CED-type missense mutations underlie a skeletal ciliopathy phenotype by perturbing ciliary protein trafficking with minor effects on ciliogenesis per se.", "label": "0"}

However, these methods are time-consuming, labourious, and limited in their application. Therefore, the development of new, more effective techniques is necessary.\nAIM: To detect the F8 and @GENE$ gene mutations in patients with @DISEASE$ and their female relatives in 29 @DISEASE$ A (HA) and 11 @DISEASE$ B (HB) families.\nMETHODS: \nFVIII: C and FIX:C were analyzed using one-stage method, and factor VIII and factor IX inhibitors were tested using the Bethesda method. Intron 22 and one inversions were identified using long-distance polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and standard PCR. Non-inversion mutations of the F8 and @GENE$ gene were identified by targeted high-throughput sequencing. All mutations were verified by Sanger sequencing.\nRESULTS: Intron 22 inversion was detected in eight HA families and intron one inversion was detected in one HA family. Apart from the inversion mutations, 20 mutations were identified in HA families, including 17 previously reported and three novel mutations: c.5724G>A (p.Trp1908*), c.6116-1_6120delGAGTGTinsTCC (p.Lys2039Ilefs*13), and c.5220-2A>C.

{"id": 212, "sentence": "Genetic anticipation in Swedish @DISEASE$ families.\nAmong hereditary colorectal cancer predisposing syndromes, @DISEASE$ (LS) caused by mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, @GENE$ or PMS2 is the most common. Patients with LS have an increased risk of early onset colon and endometrial cancer, but also other tumors that generally have an earlier onset compared to the general population. However, age at first primary cancer varies within families and genetic anticipation, i.e. decreasing age at onset in successive generations, has been suggested in LS. Anticipation is a well-known phenomenon in e.g neurodegenerative diseases and several reports have studied anticipation in heritable cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine whether anticipation can be shown in a nationwide cohort of Swedish LS families referred to the regional departments of clinical genetics in Lund, Stockholm, Linköping, Uppsala and Umeå between the years 1990-2013. We analyzed a homogenous group of mutation carriers, utilizing information from both affected and non-affected family members. In total, 239 families with a mismatch repair gene mutation (96 MLH1 families, 90 MSH2 families including one family with an EPCAM-MSH2 deletion, 39 @GENE$ families, 12 PMS2 families, and 2 MLH1+PMS2 families) comprising 1028 at-risk carriers were identified among the Swedish LS families, of which 1003 mutation carriers had available follow-up information and could be included in the study. Using a normal random effects model (NREM) we estimate a 2.1 year decrease in age of diagnosis per generation. An alternative analysis using a mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards model (COX-R) estimates a hazard ratio of exp(0.171), or about 1.19, for age of diagnosis between consecutive generations. LS-associated gene-specific anticipation effects are evident for MSH2 (2.6 years/generation for NREM and hazard ratio of 1.33 for COX-R) and PMS2 (7.3 years/generation and hazard ratio of 1.86).

CSNB is inherited as an autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked recessive trait and shows a good genotype-phenotype correlation. Clinically, CSNB is classified as the Riggs type and the Schubert-Bornschein type. The latter form is further sub-classified into complete and incomplete forms based on specific waveforms on the electroretinogram (ERG). There are no molecular genetic data for CSNB in the Indian population. Therefore, we present for the first time molecular profiling of eight families with complete CSNB (cCSNB).\nMETHODS: The index patients and their other affected family members were comprehensively evaluated for the phenotype, including complete ophthalmic evaluation, ERG, fundus autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography, and color vision test. The known gene defects for cCSNB, LRIT3, TRPM1, GRM6, @GENE$, and NYX, were screened by PCR direct sequencing. Bioinformatic analyses were performed using SIFT and PolyPhen for the identified missense mutations.\nRESULTS: All eight affected index patients and affected family members were identified as having cCSNB based on their ERG waveforms. Mutations in the TRPM1 gene were identified in six index patients. The two remaining index patients each carried a @GENE$ and GRM6 mutation. Seven of the patients revealed homozygous mutations, while one patient showed a compound heterozygous mutation.

The aim of this study was to screen DNA samples from 16 Chinese MSUD patients and assess a potential correlation between genotype and phenotype.\nMETHODS: BCKDHA, BCKDHB and @GENE$ genes were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. Segments bearing novel mutations were identified by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis.\nRESULTS: Within the variant alleles, 28 mutations (28/32, 87.5%), were detected in 15 patients, while one patient displayed no mutations.

The disease is caused by mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene (also known as FALDH and @GENE$) on chromosome 17p11.2 that encodes fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of long-chain aldehydes derived from lipid metabolism. In SLS patients, 72 mutations have been identified, with a distribution that is scattered throughout the ALDH3A2 gene. Most mutations are private but several common mutations have been detected, which probably reflect founder effects or recurrent mutational events. Missense mutations comprise the most abundant class (38%) and expression studies indicate that most of these result in a profound reduction in enzyme activity. Deletions account for about 25% of the mutations and range from single nucleotides to entire exons. Twelve splice-site mutations have been demonstrated to cause aberrant splicing in cultured fibroblasts. To date, more than a dozen intragenic ALDH3A2 polymorphisms consisting of SNPs and one microsatellite marker have been characterized, although none of them alter the FALDH protein sequence.

The disease is caused by mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene (also known as FALDH and @GENE$) on chromosome 17p11.2 that encodes fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of long-chain aldehydes derived from lipid metabolism. In SLS patients, 72 mutations have been identified, with a distribution that is scattered throughout the ALDH3A2 gene. Most mutations are private but several common mutations have been detected, which probably reflect founder effects or recurrent mutational events. Missense mutations comprise the most abundant class (38%) and expression studies indicate that most of these result in a profound reduction in enzyme activity. Deletions account for about 25% of the mutations and range from single nucleotides to entire exons. Twelve splice-site mutations have been demonstrated to cause aberrant splicing in cultured fibroblasts. To date, more than a dozen intragenic ALDH3A2 polymorphisms consisting of SNPs and one microsatellite marker have been characterized, although none of them alter the FALDH protein sequence. The striking mutational diversity in SLS offers a challenge for DNA-based diagnosis, but promises to provide a wealth of information about enzyme structure-function correlations.", "label": "0"}

As the IFT122 subunit connects the core and peripheral subcomplexes of the IFT-A complex, it is expected to play a pivotal role in the complex. Indeed, we here showed that knockout (KO) of the IFT122 gene in hTERT-RPE1 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system led to a severe ciliogenesis defect, whereas KO of other IFT-A genes had minor effects on ciliogenesis but impaired ciliary protein trafficking. Exogenous expression of not only wild-type IFT122 but also its CED-associated missense mutants, which fail to interact with other IFT-A subunits, rescued the ciliogenesis defect of IFT122-KO cells. However, IFT122-KO cells expressing CED-type IFT122 mutants showed defects in ciliary protein trafficking, such as ciliary entry of Smoothened in response to Hedgehog signaling activation. The trafficking defects partially resembled those observed in IFT144-KO cells, which demonstrate failed assembly of the functional IFT-A complex at the base of cilia.

To date, no published studies have reported on mutations in the Mediterranean fever (@GENE$) gene in patients with @DISEASE$, although the roles of @GENE$ gene mutations in FMF and FMF-associated amyloidosis (FMF-A) are well known. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the frequencies of @GENE$ gene mutations and serum amyloid A (SAA) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels in patients with @DISEASE$, FMF and FMF-A.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population included 122 patients with FMF and 128 subjects who were systemically healthy. Clinical periodontal parameters, including the plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level and percentage of bleeding on probing were recorded. Blood samples were obtained from patients with FMF and systemically healthy controls, and all mutations located on exons 2 and 10 of the @GENE$ gene were analyzed by DNA Sanger Sequencing, which is the gold standard. SAA and high-sensitive CRP levels were also assessed.\nRESULTS: Mean gingival index, percentage of bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level, and the levels of SAA and hs-CRP were higher in the FMF-A group than those in the FMF and control groups. The two most relevant mutations in patients with FMF were heterozygous M694V (46.2%), and heterozygous R202Q (32.7%). The frequencies of the homozygous M694V and R202Q mutations in the FMF-A group were 53.8% and 46.1%, respectively. The complex R202Q/M694V homozygous state led to an increased risk of @DISEASE$ (odds ratio: 3.6), and FMF-A (odds ratio: 7.6).\nCONCLUSION: This is the first study to report the R202Q mutation in patients with periodontitis.

Of these, 57 are clearly pathogenic based on multiple criteria, 10 are probably pathogenic, and 15 are probably benign. In the cohort of 200 families, 94 (47%) have one of the clearly pathogenic variants and 10 (5%) have one of the probably pathogenic variants. One family (0.5%) has digenic RDS-ROM1 mutations.

{"id": 212, "sentence": "Genetic anticipation in Swedish @DISEASE$ families.\nAmong hereditary colorectal cancer predisposing syndromes, @DISEASE$ (LS) caused by mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes @GENE$, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 is the most common. Patients with LS have an increased risk of early onset colon and endometrial cancer, but also other tumors that generally have an earlier onset compared to the general population. However, age at first primary cancer varies within families and genetic anticipation, i.e. decreasing age at onset in successive generations, has been suggested in LS. Anticipation is a well-known phenomenon in e.g neurodegenerative diseases and several reports have studied anticipation in heritable cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine whether anticipation can be shown in a nationwide cohort of Swedish LS families referred to the regional departments of clinical genetics in Lund, Stockholm, Linköping, Uppsala and Umeå between the years 1990-2013. We analyzed a homogenous group of mutation carriers, utilizing information from both affected and non-affected family members. In total, 239 families with a mismatch repair gene mutation (96 @GENE$ families, 90 MSH2 families including one family with an EPCAM-MSH2 deletion, 39 MSH6 families, 12 PMS2 families, and 2 @GENE$+PMS2 families) comprising 1028 at-risk carriers were identified among the Swedish LS families, of which 1003 mutation carriers had available follow-up information and could be included in the study. Using a normal random effects model (NREM) we estimate a 2.1 year decrease in age of diagnosis per generation. An alternative analysis using a mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards model (COX-R) estimates a hazard ratio of exp(0.171), or about 1.19, for age of diagnosis between consecutive generations. LS-associated gene-specific anticipation effects are evident for MSH2 (2.6 years/generation for NREM and hazard ratio of 1.33 for COX-R) and PMS2 (7.3 years/generation and hazard ratio of 1.86). The estimated anticipation effects for @GENE$ and MSH6 are smaller.", "label": "0"}

Mutations in the @GENE$ gene have been initially associated with autosomal recessive Stargardt disease. Subsequent studies have shown that mutations in @GENE$ can also cause a variety of other retinal dystrophies including cone rod dystrophy and @DISEASE$. To determine the prevalence and mutation spectrum of @GENE$ gene mutations in non-Stargardt phenotypes, we have screened 64 unrelated patients with autosomal recessive cone (arCD) and cone rod dystrophy (arCRD) applying the Asper Ophthalmics ABCR400 microarray followed by DNA sequencing of all coding exons of the @GENE$ gene in subjects with single heterozygous mutations. Disease-associated @GENE$ alleles were identified in 20 of 64 patients with arCD or arCRD. In four of 64 patients (6%) only one mutant @GENE$ allele was detected and in 16 patients (25%), mutations on both @GENE$ alleles were identified. Based on these data we estimate a prevalence of 31% for @GENE$ mutations in arCD and arCRD, supporting the concept that the @GENE$ gene is a major locus for various types of degenerative retinal diseases with abnormalities in cone or both cone and rod function.", "label": "0"}

However, the clinical spectra of @GENE$ GOF mutations continue to expand. We here describe two patients with @GENE$ GOF mutations presenting early in life with combined immunodeficiency (CID).\nMETHODS: Clinical data and laboratory findings including immunophenotyping, level of interferon (IFN)-γ/IL-17(+) T cells, interferon-induced @GENE$ phosphorylation, and JAK inhibitor assays were evaluated. Sequencing of @GENE$ gene was performed by Sanger sequencer.\nRESULTS: Patient 1 (P1) had persistent oral candidiasis and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection since 2 months of age and later developed cavitary lung lesions due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Patient 2 (P2) presented with oral candidiasis and recurrent pneumonia at 4 months of age and subsequently developed CMV pneumonitis. Both patients suffered heterozygous missense mutations in @GENE$, leading to deleterious amino acid substitutions in the DNA binding domain (P1: c.1154C > T; p.T385M; P2. c.971G > T; p.C324F). Circulating CD4(+) T cells of both patients exhibited increased interferon-γ and decreased IL-17 expression as compared to controls. They also exhibited increased IFN-β and -γ-induced @GENE$ phosphorylation that was reversed upon treatment with the JAK kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib.\nCONCLUSION: @GENE$ GOF mutations may present early in life with CID, consistent with the clinical heterogeneity of the disease.

Probands from each family were screened for mutations in 13 genes known to cause adRP: CA4, CRX, FSCN2, IMPDH1, NRL, PRPF3 (RP18), @GENE$ (RP13), PRPF31 (RP11), RDS, RHO, ROM1, RP1, and RP9.

{"id": 39, "sentence": "@GENE$ gene analysis in patients with autosomal recessive cone and cone rod dystrophies.\nThe ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters constitute a family of large membrane proteins, which transport a variety of substrates across membranes. The @GENE$ protein is expressed in photoreceptors and possibly functions as a transporter for N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine (N-retinylidene-PE), the Schiff base adduct of all-trans-retinal with PE. Mutations in the @GENE$ gene have been initially associated with autosomal recessive Stargardt disease. Subsequent studies have shown that mutations in @GENE$ can also cause a variety of other retinal dystrophies including @DISEASE$ and retinitis pigmentosa. To determine the prevalence and mutation spectrum of @GENE$ gene mutations in non-Stargardt phenotypes, we have screened 64 unrelated patients with autosomal recessive cone (arCD) and @DISEASE$ (arCRD) applying the Asper Ophthalmics ABCR400 microarray followed by DNA sequencing of all coding exons of the @GENE$ gene in subjects with single heterozygous mutations. Disease-associated @GENE$ alleles were identified in 20 of 64 patients with arCD or arCRD. In four of 64 patients (6%) only one mutant @GENE$ allele was detected and in 16 patients (25%), mutations on both @GENE$ alleles were identified. Based on these data we estimate a prevalence of 31% for @GENE$ mutations in arCD and arCRD, supporting the concept that the @GENE$ gene is a major locus for various types of degenerative retinal diseases with abnormalities in cone or both cone and rod function.", "label": "0"}

{"id": 5, "sentence": "@DISEASE$: diversity of mutations and polymorphisms in the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (@GENE$).\n@DISEASE$ (SLS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ichthyosis, mental retardation, and spastic diplegia or tetraplegia. The disease is caused by mutations in the @GENE$ gene (also known as FALDH and ALDH10) on chromosome 17p11.2 that encodes fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of long-chain aldehydes derived from lipid metabolism. In SLS patients, 72 mutations have been identified, with a distribution that is scattered throughout the @GENE$ gene. Most mutations are private but several common mutations have been detected, which probably reflect founder effects or recurrent mutational events. Missense mutations comprise the most abundant class (38%) and expression studies indicate that most of these result in a profound reduction in enzyme activity. Deletions account for about 25% of the mutations and range from single nucleotides to entire exons. Twelve splice-site mutations have been demonstrated to cause aberrant splicing in cultured fibroblasts. To date, more than a dozen intragenic @GENE$ polymorphisms consisting of SNPs and one microsatellite marker have been characterized, although none of them alter the FALDH protein sequence. The striking mutational diversity in SLS offers a challenge for DNA-based diagnosis, but promises to provide a wealth of information about enzyme structure-function correlations.", "label": "0"}
{"id": 173, "sentence": "Severe Early-Onset @DISEASE$ due to Heterozygous Gain-of-Function Mutations in @GENE$.\nPURPOSE: Loss and gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in human signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (@GENE$) lead to distinct phenotypes. Although recurrent infections are common to both types of @GENE$ mutations, GOF mutations are distinguished by chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and autoimmunity. However, the clinical spectra of @GENE$ GOF mutations continue to expand. We here describe two patients with @GENE$ GOF mutations presenting early in life with @DISEASE$ (CID).\nMETHODS: Clinical data and laboratory findings including immunophenotyping, level of interferon (IFN)-γ/IL-17(+) T cells, interferon-induced @GENE$ phosphorylation, and JAK inhibitor assays were evaluated. Sequencing of @GENE$ gene was performed by Sanger sequencer.\nRESULTS: Patient 1 (P1) had persistent oral candidiasis and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection since 2 months of age and later developed cavitary lung lesions due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Patient 2 (P2) presented with oral candidiasis and recurrent pneumonia at 4 months of age and subsequently developed CMV pneumonitis. Both patients suffered heterozygous missense mutations in @GENE$, leading to deleterious amino acid substitutions in the DNA binding domain (P1: c.1154C > T; p.T385M; P2. c.971G > T; p.C324F). Circulating CD4(+) T cells of both patients exhibited increased interferon-γ and decreased IL-17 expression as compared to controls. They also exhibited increased IFN-β and -γ-induced @GENE$ phosphorylation that was reversed upon treatment with the JAK kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib.\nCONCLUSION: @GENE$ GOF mutations may present early in life with CID, consistent with the clinical heterogeneity of the disease. JAK kinase inhibitors may potentially be useful in some patients as adjunct therapy pending definitive treatment with bone marrow transplantation.", "label": "0"}

{"id": 126, "sentence": "Molecular profiling of complete @DISEASE$: a pilot study on an Indian cohort.\nPURPOSE: @DISEASE$ (CSNB) is a non-progressive retinal disorder that shows genetic and clinical heterogeneity. CSNB is inherited as an autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked recessive trait and shows a good genotype-phenotype correlation. Clinically, CSNB is classified as the Riggs type and the Schubert-Bornschein type. The latter form is further sub-classified into complete and incomplete forms based on specific waveforms on the electroretinogram (ERG). There are no molecular genetic data for CSNB in the Indian population. Therefore, we present for the first time molecular profiling of eight families with complete CSNB (cCSNB).\nMETHODS: The index patients and their other affected family members were comprehensively evaluated for the phenotype, including complete ophthalmic evaluation, ERG, fundus autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography, and color vision test. The known gene defects for cCSNB, LRIT3, @GENE$, GRM6, GPR179, and NYX, were screened by PCR direct sequencing. Bioinformatic analyses were performed using SIFT and PolyPhen for the identified missense mutations.\nRESULTS: All eight affected index patients and affected family members were identified as having cCSNB based on their ERG waveforms. Mutations in the @GENE$ gene were identified in six index patients. The two remaining index patients each carried a GPR179 and GRM6 mutation. Seven of the patients revealed homozygous mutations, while one patient showed a compound heterozygous mutation. Six of the eight mutations identified are novel.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on molecular profiling of candidate genes in CSNB in an Indian cohort. As shown for other cohorts, @GENE$ seems to be a major gene defect in patients with cCSNB in India.", "label": "0"}
