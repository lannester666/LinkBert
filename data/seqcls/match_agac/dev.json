We screened @GENE$ in a large cohort of patients with different clinical subtypes of @DISEASE$ (USH) to determine the prevalence of @GENE$ mutations among USH patients.\nMETHODS: @GENE$ was screened in 149 USH2, 29 USH1, six atypical USH, and 11 unclassified USH patients from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Mutation detection was performed by direct sequencing of all coding exons.\nRESULTS: We identified 38 different variants among 195 patients. Most variants were clearly polymorphic, but at least two out of the 15 nonsynonymous variants (p.R350W and p.R882S) are predicted to impair whirlin structure and function, suggesting eventual pathogenicity. No putatively pathogenic mutation was found in the second allele of patients with these mutations.\nCONCLUSIONS: @GENE$ is not a major cause of USH.", "label": "LOF"}

The goals of this study were first to measure in controls the frequency of @GENE$ variations described in HPI patients, second to assess the functional effect of @GENE$ mutations on POX activity, and finally to establish genotype/enzymatic activity correlations in a new series of HPI patients. Eight of 14 variants occurred at polymorphic frequency in 114 controls. POX activity was determined for six novel mutations and two haplotypes. The c.1331G>A, p.G444D allele has a drastic effect, whereas the c.23C>T, p.P8L allele and the c.[56C>A; 172G>A], p.[Q19P; A58T] haplotype result in a moderate decrease in activity.

At age 47, she noticed distal muscle weakness and atrophy in her legs. Physical examination revealed atrophy and weakness of small hand muscles and mild atrophy and weakness of the lower limbs. There was generalized hyperreflexia with the exception of ankle reflexes which were diminished. Her 25year-old son had only stiffness of both legs at the age of 22.

The clinical manifestations and MRI features were retrospectively collected and analysed in the 33 index patients with confirmed diagnosis and their available affected family members.\nRESULTS: 20 different @GENE$ mutations were identified in 33 families, including seven novel mutations. The highest mutation frequency was in exons 4 (55%) and 3 (30%). Granular osmiophilic material in smooth muscle cells was found in 30 cases who were biopsied. Clinical presentation included TIA/stroke in 82%, cognitive decline in 60%, and migraine with aura in only 5% of 57 symptomatic cases.
